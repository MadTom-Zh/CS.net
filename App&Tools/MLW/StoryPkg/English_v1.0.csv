1,Berith,I-1,,,Berith,,
,,,,,"Nothing much has changed, huh.",,
,,,,,Humans are looking pathetic as usual.,,
,,,,,,(Why is she looking at me like that...),
,,,,,What do you want?,,
,,,,,,N-no... I just figured that we should get to know each other...,
,,,,,A mere mortal like you? Psh.,,
,,,,,What do you even know about succubus anyway?,,
,,,1-1-A,I-2,More about you.,,
,,,,,,"Umm, actually, I'm more interested to learn about you.",
,,,,,How impudent.,,
,,,,,Let this sink into your thin skull. I'm not here to entertain you.,,
,,,,,Let's get this over with. I have more important things to do.,,
,,,,,,I- I don't think this can be rushed...,
,,,,,"Tskk, so slow.",,
,,,1-1-B,II-4,I'm not sure.,,
,,,,,,I... I don't really know myself.,
,,,,,,I only know that there are many types of succubus...,
,,,,,,And you are all truly intriguing.,
,,,,,What was that?,,
,,,,,,...?,
,,,,,You insolent...,,
,,,,,Don't lump me with other lowly succubi!,,
,,,,,,(Why is she mad?),
,,I-2,,,,,
,,,,,"Oh, it's just you.",,
,,,,,You done with your business?,,
,,,,,,Not yet...,
,,,,,"Ugh, so troublesome.",,
,,,,,I just want to go back home. My kind are waiting for me.,,
,,,1-2-A,,Your kind?,,
,,,,,,Do you mean that there are many others who are like you?,
,,,,,"They might not be as perfect as I am, but, my kind is the best.",,
,,,,,"I mean, we're the ones who were trusted by the Demon Queen herself.",,
,,,1-2-A-A,II-1,Demon Queen.,,
,,,,,,The Demon Queen?,
,,,,,"The ruler of the Demon Realm, of course.",,
,,,,,,That's awesone... That must mean you're really powerful!,
,,,,,Are you mocking me? Of course I am!,,
,,,,,"In fact, why don't I test my power on you now, since you're so annoying?",,
,,,,,,P-please don't...,
,,,,,Tch.,,
,,,1-2-A-B,II-3,Were?,,
,,,,,,Why are you talking in the past tense?,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,Is there something wrong?,
,,,,,It's because... Her Highness is...,,
,,,,,If only she were still here... I... We... We wouldn't have...,,
,,,,,We wouldn't have to face this humiliation.,,
,,,,,,(I better go...),
,,,1-2-B,,Go back home.,,
,,,,,,You can't go back home?,
,,,,,Sigh.,,
,,,,,"I hate to say this, but I have to carry out my duties.",,
,,,1-2-B-A,II-4,Admirable duty.,,
,,,,,,"Going to the Human Realm and carrying your duty for hundreds- no, thousands of years...",
,,,,,Don't get me wrong.,,
,,,,,Collecting Carnal Essence from human men is just a basic need to us succubi.,,
,,,,,My kind have a more noble duty to carry out.,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,What?,,
,,,,,,"Ah, no, I just think that it's really admirable.",
,,,,,Mmhm.,,
,,,,,,,
,,,1-2-B-B,I-3,I can't imagine.,,
,,,,,,Ugh... I can't imagine having to do that for thousands of years.,
,,,,,What do you mean?,,
,,,,,,Going to the Human Realm... and preying on men...,
,,,,,You think we WANT to?, ,
,,,,,Don't think so highly of yourself.,,
,,,,,The only thing that's good about you humans... is your Carnal Essence.,,
,,,,,,That's not what I-,
,,,,,Scram!,,
,,,,,,,
,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,,"Excuse me, umm...",
,,,,,State your business. I don't have much time to spare.,,
,,,,,,Do you need anything?,
,,,,,,I figured if I can be of any help...,
,,,,,"Hmph, you think I'd fall for your act?",,
,,,1-3-A,II-3,I'm your summoner.,,
,,,,,,But I was the one who summoned you here...,
,,,,,And? You think I owe you something?,,
,,,,,"Know your place, fool! You are merely prey.",,
,,,,,"Once this ends, I'll suck you dry and throw you away.",,
,,,,,,...!,
,,,,,You should be grateful that I will be the one who will take your life.,,
,,,,,"After all, you're in the presence of the right hand of the Demon Queen herself!",,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,1-3-B,II-4,You are so hostile.,,
,,,,,,Are all other succubi like you...?,
,,,,,What do you mean by that?,,
,,,,,,Ah? N- nothing.,
,,,,,,"I mean, since there must be a lot of succubi...",
,,,,,Those lowly succubi...,,
,,,,,They have forgotten the most important thing in the realm and then live as they please!,,
,,,,,They are nothing compared to me... Compared to my kind!,,
,,,,,,(Seems like she didn't hear me.),
,,II-1,,,,,
,,,,,Her Highness Agrath...,,
,,,,,,Agrath? Is she the Demon Queen?,
,,,,,Do not speak so casually of her!,,
,,,,,,I- I'm sorry. She must be very important to you.,
,,,,,We've been by her side ever since the beginning.,,
,,,,,We were her only trusted succubi.,,
,,,,,Yet the others dare to forget about us!,,
,,,2-1-A,II-3,Don't dwell on the past.,,
,,,,,,"This is just my two cents, but...",
,,,,,,"I think you should accept the fact that she's no longer here, and move on...",
,,,,,,It's kind of painful seeing you holding on to anger like that...,
,,,,,...!,,
,,,,,Speak for yourself!,,
,,,,,You think I don't know what you're plotting right now?!,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,,(I... with Luna...),
,,,,,,,
,,,2-1-B,II-2,What about now?,,
,,,,,,What happened now that she's gone...?,
,,,,,"Gone- but I'm still here, aren't I!?",,
,,,,,It's only logical that we should always be the ruler's right hand.,,
,,,,,Yet the new ruler chose another kind of succubi.,,
,,,,,,"Well, I think I can understand why you're so bitter...",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,,
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,,How are you doing?,
,,,,,Don't act all nice with me.,,
,,,,,,I'm just worried...,
,,,,,Worried? About me?,,
,,,,,You should just be worried about yourself.,,
,,,,,"After all, there's nothing that I can't do.",,
,,,,,Even reclaiming my place as the ruler's right hand.,,
,,,2-2-A,III-3,Why are you so obsessed?,,
,,,,,,Why do you seem so obsessed with that?,
,,,,,... So what if I am?,,
,,,,,Being trusted by the only ruler...,,
,,,,,Other succubi would not dare ignore me.,,
,,,,,,They're ignoring you?,
,,,,,S- shut up...!,,
,,,,,,,
,,,2-2-B,III-1,I'm rooting for you.,,
,,,,,,"I also think you're worthy of that place, seeing how you yearn for it.",
,,,,,Yearn?,,
,,,,,"I also work for it, you know.",,
,,,,,,Ah... Yes.,
,,,,,If only they didn't exist...,,
,,,,,Ugh. Thinking about them makes me mad.,,
,,,,,,,
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,,I was wondering...,
,,,,,,How's your relationship with other succubi now?,
,,,,,What's with that question...,,
,,,,,Of course they respect me!,,
,,,,,They should respect me...,,
,,,,,,Hm? You sound uncertain.,
,,,,,Tsk. Quit being so nosy.,,
,,,,,I was the right hand of the Demon Queen! How dare they not respect me!,,
,,,2-3-A,III-3,You were.,,
,,,,,,"It's different now, isn't it?",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,Why do you want to be looked up to by the others so badly?,
,,,,,It's-!,,
,,,,,,You working hard is already great.,
,,,,,,"But... how about doing it for yourself, not for the others?",
,,,,,All my life... Everything I knew was about serving the ruler of the realm.,,
,,,,,So don't go around spouting nonsense...,,
,,,,,,(Did my words get to her?),
,,,,,,,
,,,2-3-B,III-1,About other succubi.,,
,,,,,,"What do you think about the others, then?",
,,,,,Everyong is so ignorant.,,
,,,,,"Even the new ruler, he... trust a different kind...",,
,,,,,Even though we were the ones who stood by Her Highness all her life.,,
,,,,,,Why did he do that?,
,,,,,"Hmph, he think that it's all about power!",,
,,,,,"That kind is still immature. They know nothing about the realm, unlike us.",,
,,,,,,That certainly sounds worrisome.,
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,"Tskk, this is tressing me out.",,
,,,,,,What is?,
,,,,,I've been staying too long in this realm.,,
,,,,,And living with other succubi drives me mad!,,
,,,,,,Oh? What is it like in your realm?,
,,,,,"You mean, how do I live in my realm?",,
,,,2-4-A,III-1,Living with the others.,,
,,,,,,"I mean, how do you live with the others?",
,,,,,Hmph. Our kind don't need the others.,,
,,,,,Why should we get close with them?,,
,,,,,,I thought that all succubi live harmoniously together...,
,,,,,"Pfft, don't make me laugh!",,
,,,,,My kind only need each other.,,
,,,,,"And we'll show the others what we're capable of becoming, once more.",,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,2-4-B,III-4,How she lived.,,
,,,,,,How's your life there?,
,,,,,I work very hard.,,
,,,,,Living my life as a succubus for thousands of years.,,
,,,,,Overseeing each and every side of the realm...,,
,,,,,I still do it even though she's no longer here.,,
,,,,,,Who is she?,
,,,,,"The demon queen, of course. Ruler of the succubus realm.",,
,,,,,,"So, you don't have a ruler anymore?",
,,,,,...It's... the Master...,,
,,,,,"Ugghh, I don't want to talk about it.",,
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,Those succubi really get on my nerves...,,
,,,,,,Do you have a problem with someone?,
,,,,,The Enyo kind...,,
,,,,,I can't believe Master Asmodeus chose them over us.,,
,,,,,,(Oh... The new ruler of their realm?),
,,,,,"Grrr... It can't be helped, since he just took Queen Agrath's throne out of nowhere.",,
,,,,,He doesn't know who's best suited to be the ruler's right hand.,,
,,,,,But I'll make him understand!,,
,,,3-1-A,III-2,Rivalry with Enyo,,
,,,,,,Perhaps you're overlooking things about them?,
,,,,,Of course not!,,
,,,,,They are only good with their fists.,,
,,,,,They don't know how to use their brains.,,
,,,,,,Is that so...,
,,,,,What? Do you want to complain?,,
,,,,,,N- no.,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,3-1-B,III-3,I like your determination.,,
,,,,,,As I thought... I really like your determination.,
,,,,,,It kinda reminds me of my wife.,
,,,,,,"She was a hard worker, and...",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,"O- oh, sorry.",
,,,,,,"I mean, your determination deserves to be recognized.",
,,,,,"Of course, only a fool can't see my best qualities.",,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,,Are you still upset about Enyo?,
,,,,,I'm not.,,
,,,,,,But you don't look like you're fine.,
,,,,,Grrr... Noisy as always.,,
,,,,,It's not that I hould a grudge against them.,,
,,,,,,You just can't accept the fact that Asmodeus didn't choose you?,
,,,,,Shut your filthy mouth!,,
,,,3-2-A,EA,Be happy for yourself.,,
,,,,,,"Sorry, I just blurted it out...",
,,,,,,But it's a relief to hear that you don't actually hold a grudge.,
,,,,,,You're strong and your effort is truly remarkable.,
,,,,,"W- what, you're trying to sweet-talk me?",,
,,,,,,O- of course not...,
,,,,,,"Look, it would be a waste if you're only doing it for validation from others.",
,,,,,,You'll be much happier if you're doing it for yourself.,
,,,,,... Cheeky human.,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,3-2-B,EB,I'd choose you.,,
,,,,,,"S- sorry, What I'm trying to say is...",
,,,,,,It's a shame that Asmodeus didn't see that quality in you.,
,,,,,,"If I were him, I'd definitely choose you.",
,,,,,"I know, right.",,
,,,,,,"No, really. You're strong, diligent, a true hard worker.",
,,,,,,(Just like my Luna),
,,,,,Mmhm. It seems you're not as stupid as I thought.,,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,What is it? Speak.,,
,,,,,,I'm wondering... Why did the Demon Queen choose you to be her right hand?,
,,,,,What's that supposed to mean?,,
,,,,,,"I- I mean, it's kinda odd that the new ruler just overlooked you.",
,,,,,"Tch, why didn't you say that from the beginning?",,
,,,,,Our kind were the very first succubi in existence.,,
,,,,,"We know everything about the Demon Realm, and about being a succbus.",,
,,,,,It was only natural that Her Highness trusted us to handle her nusiness.,,
,,,3-3-A,EA,Be like Agrath.,,
,,,,,,To be the queen of succubi... she must be really amazing.,
,,,,,She was smart and powerful. No one dared to defy her.,,
,,,,,,"I can see how you took pride in your position, however...",
,,,,,"Just say it, don't make me lose patience.",,
,,,,,,You're already great as you are.,
,,,,,,"But why don't you just be your own person, just like Agrath?",
,,,,,,You can find your own purpose. Don't mind about what others think.,
,,,,,,Wouldn't you be more content that way?,
,,,,,...!,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,3-3-B,EB,That makes sense.,,
,,,,,,"And you have served her for a really long time, no?",
,,,,,That's correct.,,
,,,,,,Your dedication is really something...,
,,,,,,I like a woman like you.,
,,,,,You have a good eye.,,
,,,,,"In fact, why don't you be my devoted follower?",,
,,,,,,F- follower...?,
,,,,,"That way, you’ll be able to serve me for the rest of your life.",,
,,,,,"That's what you want, isn't it?",,
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,...You again.,,
,,,,,,I- I didn't mean to interrupt...,
,,,,,"You're just like him, appearing out of nowhere.",,
,,,,,,Him?,
,,,,,Master Asmodeus...,,
,,,,,,Master- I remember we were talking about that before.,
,,,,,Proving ourselves to him... How Long has it been...,,
,,,,,"But I won't give up, for the sake of my kind.",,
,,,3-4-A,EB,You remind me of her.,,
,,,,,,"You know, you kind of remind me of her...",
,,,,,You dare compare me with a human?!,,
,,,,,,T- that’s not...,
,,,,,,"What I'm trying to say is that, your determination is really admirable.",
,,,,,Hmph.,,
,,,,,What? Don't say anything cheesy like you’ve fallen in love with me now!,,
,,,,,,...Huh? Of course not... I still love my wife...,
,,,,,Dead wife.,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,,,
,,,3-4-B,III-1,What are you trying to prove?,,
,,,,,,"It sounds exhausting, though...",
,,,,,,"What are you trying to prove to him, exactly?",
,,,,,That I'm better than that Kind...,,
,,,,,,That kind...?,
,,,,,Just thinking about them makes me sick.,,
,,,,,,"Oh. okay, I won’t force you to talk about that...",
,,,,,Wise decision.,,
,,,,,"Why don't we talk about how great I am, instead?",,
,,,,,,(Un-oh.),
,,,,,,,
,,EA,,,Throwing away her pride was a liberating decision ofr Berith.,,
,,,,,She feels content now that she's able to break through her fear of prejudice.,,
,,,,,Her heart softens for the man who has helped her find her purpose.,,
,,,,,"It is Jake, happy with his new life with Berith.",,
,,EB,,,Jake sees the hardworking Luna in Berith.,,
,,,,,"Consumed by his own thoughts, he decides that Berith is the perfect substitute for Luna.",,
,,,,,"However, she is not exactly the woman Jake pictured her to be.",,
,,,,,For she wants nothing more than to take control of his life.,,
,,,,,,,
2,Kalys,,,,Kalys,,
,,I-1,,,,,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,Are you okay?,
,,,,,"O- oh, erm....Yes....",,
,,,,,,You look kind of glum...,
,,,,,It’s just my face... Sorry....,,
,,,1-1-A,I-2,Nothing wrong with your face.,,
,,,,,,There's nothing wrong with your face.,
,,,,,D-d-don't stare at me too much...,,
,,,,,,"Ah, sorry.",
,,,,,,"(Maybe she feels uneasy, suddenly summoned to an unfamiliar place.)",
,,,,,,"Umm, do you want to take a look around the house?",
,,,,,Don’t’... Don’t Worry...,,fontSize=Small1
,,,,,,Huh? Are you saying something?,
,,,,,,(Her voice is so low.),
,,,,,Don't worry... about me... I'm good...,,
,,,,,,"Well, if you say so...",
,,,,,,"Just make yourself at home, okay?",
,,,,,,,
,,,1-1-B,II-3,Tell me if you need something.,,
,,,,,,"Um, if you need anything, please don't hesitate to ask, ok?",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,There's no need to be scared.,
,,,,,I- I mustn’t... speak...,,fontSize=Small1
,,,,,,What was that? I can't hear you...,
,,,,,I mustn't speak... Or else he will...,,fontSize=Small1
,,,,,,He?,
,,,,,...,,

,,,,,,"I’ll... I’ll leave you alone for now, then.",
,,I-2,,,,,
,,,,,... I-Is something wrong?,,
,,,,,,"Oh, no, it's-",
,,,,,,The thing around your neck... is it an accessory?,
,,,,,Access... ory... ?,,
,,,,,,"Your necklace, I mean.",
,,,,,This is...,,
,,,,,Not an accessory...,,
,,,1-2-A,II-4,Do you like it?,,
,,,,,,"So, you like wearing it?",
,,,,,It's... It's not like that...,,
,,,,,This is... They gave it to us...,,fontSize=Small1
,,,,,,I- I can't hear you. Your voice is very low.,
,,,,,It's for protection...,,
,,,,,,Like a protective charm?,
,,,,,Kind of...,,
,,,,,,,
,,,1-2-B,II-1,Why do you wear it?,,
,,,,,,It looks heavy... Why do you wear it?,
,,,,,It’s... a part of me... a part of our kind.,,
,,,,,,Everyone wears that?,
,,,,,Yes... Just like we should...,,
,,,,,,Did someone give you that?,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,Okay. You don't have to talk if you don't want to.,
,,,,,Understood...,,
,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,,"Oh, Kalys, you are here.",
,,,,,Is there... something wrong?,,fontSize=Small1
,,,,,,I- I can't quite hear you.,
,,,,,Something... something wrong...?,,fontSize=Small1
,,,,,,...Excuse me.,
,,,,,!!,,
,,,,,,"Ah, sorry!",
,,,,,,I figured I should get closer so I can hear you...,
,,,,,It’s... okay...,,
,,,1-3-A,II-3,Something bothering you?,,
,,,,,,Is something bothering you?,
,,,,,N- nothing... It's just...,,
,,,,,The Master won't like it... if I talk too much...,,
,,,,,,The Master?,
,,,,,"O- oh, I mustn't speak about him...!",,
,,,,,Please... Please forget about it.,,
,,,,,I know... it’s not my place to make a request....,,
,,,,,,"Let's calm down first, okay?",
,,,,,,I won't force you to talk if you don't want to.,
,,,,,...,,
,,,1-3-B,I-2,Why are you whispering?,,
,,,,,,Do you always speak so quietly?,
,,,,,I’m- I’m just not used to... someone talking to me...,,
,,,,,Sorry... if I can't respond well...,,
,,,,,,"Oh, don't worry about it.",
,,,,,,I was being insensitive.,
,,,,,"N- no, it's my fault.",,
,,,,,They... They told me to Speak... only if I'm asked.,,
,,,,,You were asking something... yet I can't respond well.,,
,,,,,I’m sorry.,,
,,II-1,,,,,

,,,,,W- what should I c- call you then...,,
,,,,,,"Just ""Jake"" is fine.",
,,,,,B- but you’re my master here...,,
,,,,,,It feels weird being called like that.,
,,,,,,Like... uhh... like we're in some kind of a weird play.,
,,,,,Huh? I... I don't understand.,,
,,,2-1-A,II-2,What is your role in the Demon Realm?,,
,,,,,,"Umm, I don't know if it's okay to ask you this, but...",
,,,,,,What do you do in the Demon Realm?,
,,,,,I... I'm...,,
,,,,,I'm just someone who follows the orders of the Master...,,
,,,,,That's what my kind is supposed to do.,,
,,,,,,"...Well, you’re really different from the other succubi I’ve seen.",
,,,,,,How to put it... You're exceptionally obedient.,
,,,,,Is that... a good thing? Or a bad thing...?,,
,,,,,I don't understand...,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,2-1-B,II-3,Your master in the Demon Realm?,,
,,,,,,Did the Master in the Demon Realm tell you to call him that?,
,,,,,No... Everyone addresses him like that...,,
,,,,,And they... they told me I should do the same.,,
,,,,,I’m just following what's best for me...,,
,,,,,,What's best for you?,
,,,,,Uhh... um... I mean... If I do what I'm told...,,
,,,,,Then they'll let me live...?,,
,,,,,,?!,
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,Can I be of any more use to you...?,,
,,,,,,Huh? Why so sudden?,
,,,,,,You've done so much for me already.,
,,,,,,"... If anything, I'm the one who's being selfish here.",
,,,,,W- what... do you mean?,,
,,,,,,I'm sorry... I'm doing all of this for my own goal...,
,,,,,,I even use you succubi...,
,,,,,,I'm the worst.,
,,,,,... At least... at least you still have a goal...,,
,,,2-2-A,III-1,What about you?,,
,,,,,,"Well, what about you?",
,,,,,,Do you have anything you want to achieve?,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,I’m- I’m content with what I have...,,
,,,,,I'm just glad that I'm safe...,,
,,,,,That they protected me...,,
,,,,,,Who are they?,
,,,,,Ah...,,
,,,,,,I just realized you speak about them a lot.,
,,,,,,...If you don't mind me asking?,
,,,,,M- maybe... next time...,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,2-2-B,III-3,You should have one as well.,,
,,,,,,"Ah, you must have a goal too, right?",
,,,,,,The other succubi seem like they have their own ambitions.,
,,,,,I... don't have the audacity to even think about doing that...,,
,,,,,,"What's stopping you, though?",
,,,,,I... I can’t... I have to follow orders...,,
,,,,,I don't dare to... even think about having my own goals...,,
,,,,,,"I'm sorry for saying this, but...",
,,,,,,I think it would be splendid if you could find your own goals to work towards.,
,,,,,Uuu...,,
,,,,,,I- it doesn't have to be right now!,
,,,,,,Maybe we can find it together while you're here.,
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,,As I thought... You really are different from the other succubi.,
,,,,,...?,,
,,,,,,You’re really quiet.,
,,,,,I just... I just don't have anything to say...,,
,,,,,Even if I did...,,
,,,,,M- my thoughts would be of no importance...,,
,,,,,,Why do you think so?,
,,,,,I- I was told...,,
,,,,,It's so the Master... won't harm me...,,
,,,2-3-A,III-3,Has he ever harmed you?,,
,,,,,,"Has the Master ever harmed you, though?",
,,,,,!,,
,,,,,N- no...,,
,,,,,I... We... We don't interact much either...,,
, ,,,,,"Then... you actually have nothing to be afraid of, right?",
,,,,,,Do you think they would mind... if you stay here?,
,,,,,...I'm not sure.,,
,,,,,,It... it's just a thought. Don't take it too seriously.,
,,,,,Huh? Okay...,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,2-3-B,III-1,Are other succubi also afraid of the Master?,,
,,,,,,Are other succubi also afraid of the Master?,
,,,,,I- I think so...,,
,,,,,"I’m... I’m not sure, but...",,
,,,,,,But?,
,,,,,Uhh... S- sorry...,,
,,,,,I... actually don't know...,,
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,Ugh... It's stuck...,,
,,,,,,What happened?,
,,,,,It's... the chain... I- I think it got Stuck...,,
,,,,,,Let me help you.,
,,,,,O- oh... You don't have to...,,
,,,,,,There you go.,
,,,,,,......,
,,,,,A- are you... done?,,
,,,,,,"Y- yes, umm, why are you still wearing it?",
,,,,,,"Does it not hinder you? The shackles, I mean...",
,,,,,I- I feel... safe.,,
,,,,,I feel safe... when I wear them.,,
,,,2-4-A,II-5,Unique charm.,,
,,,,,,That's... how should I say it...,
,,,,,,Unique?,
,,,,,W- why is that?,,
,,,,,,"Normally, shackles are used to... you know...",
,,,,,,To restrain people?,
,,,,,,Yet how do you feel safe while being restrained?,
,,,,,It's... not a restrain.,,
,,,,,The Bastet kind... have been protecting us...,,
,,,,,We can’t... we can’t live without them...,,
,,,,,A- and so... they gave these shackles to us...,,
,,,,,,,
,,,2-4-B,III-3,Feel safe?,,
,,,,,,You feel safe wearing it?,
,,,,,Y- yes. After all... they gave it to us...,,
,,,,,,"Who are they, if I may ask?",
,,,,,The Bastet kind...,,
,,,,,They have been telling us... how to survive.,,
,,,,,If it's not because of them... t-the Master... he...,,
,,,,,He might annihilate us...,,
,,,,,,That's really heavy.,

,,,,,N- no... It’s for... the other succubi...,,
,,,,,They... told me to fix their dresses.,,

,,,,,,Are they bullying you?,
,,,,,I... no... I'm just... doing my duty... to serve the others...,,
,,,3-1-A,III-2,Serving the others?,,

,,,,,T- that's correct...,,
,,,,,,Then why...,

,,,,,It's... what they told me...,,
,,,,,,Who are they? All succubi?,
,,,,,It- it's... the Bastet kind.,,

,,,,,That's what he claimed.,,

,,,,,ARGH! HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW?!?,,
,,,,,SHE JUST VANISHED!,,
,,,,,,...,
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,Did you bring someone who can fight?,,

,,,2-2-A,II-4,Why did you lose?,,

,,,,,HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN TO KEEP ME HERE?!,,
,,,,,,Sorry...,
,,,,,,I... need more time...,

,,,,,With as much Carnal Essence as I've been collecting...,,

,,,,,,A- aren't you taking it too literally...?,
,,,2-3-B,III-2,Reason for fighting him?,,
,,,,,,I might be wrong but...,
,,,,,,Is it actually because of Queen Agrath?,
,,,,,Why do you suddenly bring her name up?,,
,,,,,,"Well... Asmodeus is her son, right?",
,,,,,,"Do you, perhaps, think that he's not worthy of the throne?",
,,,,,...That's not it.,,
,,,,,I told you I only like to fight!,,
,,,,,IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER!,,
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,Ugh... I smell.,,

,,,,,I smell different. Must be because I've been staying here too long.,,

,,,,,Asmodeus.,,
,,,2-4-A,III-1,His smell?,,

,,,,,It's been a long time since I fought him.,,
,,,,,,"So you're not sure either, huh...",
,,,,,YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?!,,
,,,,,,N- no... Not at all!,
,,,,,,I’m- I'm just curious about how we smell different.,

,,,2-4-B,III-4,Are you thinking...,,
,,,,,,D- do you think that he's....?,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,That's not possible.,,
,,,,,There's no way he could beat us if he was human.,,

,,,,,?!,,
,,,,,Where did you hear about him?,,

,,,,,Ugh. What a bunch of gossipers.,,

,,,2-5-B,III-2,Higher demon?,,
,,,,,,"So, even other succubi are no match for you?",

,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,,"In your realm, what kind of training did you go through?",

,,,,,,W- why would you go through all that?,
,,,,,The queen...,,
,,,,,"She challenged us a long, long time ago.",,
,,,,,But no one ever succeeded in defeating her.,,
,,,,,That's why we have to be strong...,,
,,,,,"No, we have to be the strongest.",,

,,,,,That's just our nature. We live to fight and triumph!,,

,,,,,,Is it perhaps because he reminds you of Agrath?,
,,,,,What was that?!,,

,,,,,Even an idiot could tell.,,
,,,,,Quit stating the obvious.,,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,,You look kind of worn out...,
,,,,,"No, I’m not.",,
,,,,,My training here is nothing compared to what I’ve been through in the realm.,,
,,,,,How can I be tired?!,,
,,,,,,N- no... Seems like you have a lot of things going on in your mind...,

,,,,,"Tch, what are you trying to pull, Mr. know-it-all?",,
,,,3-2-A,EB,Who are you fighting for?,,
,,,,,,All this time...,
,,,,,,Have you been fighting because you can’t forget her?,

,,,,,I never felt so alive!,,
,,,,,,That’s why... You’re still chasing her shadow.,

,,,,,SHUT YOUR MOUTH!,,
,,,3-2-B,III-4,What’s so special about Agrath?,,

,,,,,Unlike Her Highness who had a strong demonic aura...,,
,,,,,,...What about him?,
,,,,,Never mind. It has nothing to do with you.,,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,I see her picture everywhere.,,
,,,,,,Whose picture?,

,,,,,No. It's distracting me.,,

,,,,,,Luna... she's a very important person to me.,

,,,3-3-A,EA,I’m doing the best I can.,,

,,,,,Acting all weak like that won't help!,,
,,,,,,I’m... I’m not a fighter like you.,

,,,,,,"Like you fighting... and it's all for Agrath, right?",
,,,,,...,,
,,,3-3-B,EB,Might be the same as you to Agrath.,,

,,,,,,Did you feel confused about your feelings towards her?,
,,,,,Urgghhh...,,
,,,,,She was powerful beyond measure... I don't know what happened to her...,,
,,,,,All this time I trained...,,

,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,Too peaceful...,,
,,,,,,Are you finally feeling content here?,
,,,,,You wish.,,
,,,,,I need an adrenaline rush!,,
,,,,,,You're too powerful for us.,
,,,,,,If only I can find at least someone like your kind...,
,,,,,It would be even better if you could bring Asmodeus here to fight with me.,,
,,,,,,T- that's asking too much...,
,,,3-4-A,EB,How about Agrath?,,
,,,,,"Better than asking for you to find the queen, though.",,
,,,,,,...Do you think that... she could still be alive?,
,,,,,That's impossible.,,
,,,,,She disappeared thousands of years ago.,,
,,,,,,"But she's a demon, right?",
,,,,,,She could still be alive now.,
,,,,,Argh! Stop talking!,,
,,,,,Her son himself came to the realm and claimed her throne.,,
,,,,,That's enough proof for me!,,
,,,3-4-B,EA,I don't even know him.,,
,,,,,,"Besides, I don't know him...",
,,,,,"Psch, you won't even have the chance to see him.",,
,,,,,He's always busy with something.,,

,,,,,,I think you shouldn't touch anything when you're drunk?,
,,,,,All righty... Makes sense!,,
,,,,,"Oh, but... I'm always drunk, remember?",,
,,,,,Hahaha!,,
,,,,,,"W- well, just don't touch anything, then.",
,,,,,,At least you won't break things anymore.,
,,,,,"You're right, you're right...",,
,,,,,Will *hic* do...,,
,,,,,,"Thanks, Nocti.",
,,II-1,,,,,
,,,,,"Jakeyyy, you're here! You look greatttt!",,
,,,,,,"And you look, er, like always.",
,,,,,"Come on, I still do my job properly... I think?",,
,,,,,"I did good, didn’t I?!",,
,,,,,,"Well... You did okay, but are you sure those crystals don't bother you at work?",
,,,,,Naaah...,,
,,,,,,"I'm curious, though...",
,,,,,,Other succubi don't get drunk like your kind.,
,,,,,It's because of the Kasu! They might know why!,,
,,,2-1-A,II-2,About the Kasu...,,
,,,,,,Who are the Kasu you're talking about?,
,,,,,Fellow succubi... but they... they like to add stuff... to our bodies?,,
,,,,,,Why do you sound unsure?,
,,,,,Maybe you can call it an experiment on us?,,
,,,,,"They really, really like Carnal Essence! And their Carnal Essence tastes great!",,
,,,,,,"That sounds shady, are you all right?",
,,,,,,Doesn't being drunk prevent you from thinking clearly?,
,,,,,Nope! I'm okie-dokie!,,
,,,,,Besides getting drunk... I also love to cuddle!,,
,,,,,,Huh? Does cuddling calm you down?,
,,,,,It's a good way to sleep faster... Hehe.,,
,,,,,,"(Does she want to...? Ah, forget it.)",
,,,2-1-B,II-3,All your kind five like this?,,
,,,,,,Does every member of your kind live like this?,
,,,,,What's *hic* wrong with living this way?,,
,,,,,,It's... really not healthy for both your body and mind.,
,,,,,Naaaaaah. It makes us strong!,,
,,,,,,But it could be dangerous when you're at Work...,
,,,,,Oh... ho?,,
,,,,,That's right... I didn't realize...,,
,,,,,,"Control yourself, okay? Especially when you're at work.",
,,,,,Aye-aye!,,
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,,(Looking at her like this makes me uncomfortable every time...),
,,,,,,(I pity her...),
,,,,,Hellooo? Earth to Jakeeeeey?,,
,,,,,,W- whoa!,
,,,,,,You startled me.,
,,,,,You've been staring into space... What's up?,,
,,,,,,"N- no, I was just thinking about the Kasu.",
,,,,,,"What exactly did they do to your kind that made you look like, uh, like this?",
,,,,,"Dunno. When I woke up, I was already like this.",,
,,,2-2-A,III-1,Why did you let them do it?,,
,,,,,,Why did you let them do that to you?,
,,,,,It doesn't do us any harm... It makes us strong... We feel great!,,
,,,,,,From what I can see...,
,,,,,,Tt looks like they are taking advantage of you to experiment on your bodies.,
,,,,,Huh? That's odd. I've never thought about it like that...,,
,,,,,"Well, I don't even like to think! Hahaha!",,
,,,,,,"Try not to consume too much Carnal Essence, OK?",
,,,,,I can't...,,
,,,,,,It seems like you're already addicted to it.,
,,,,,Maybe?,,
,,,,,,(I wonder if there's something I can do...),
,,,2-2-B,II-3,Why did they do that?,,
,,,,,,Why do the Kasu like to experiment on your kind so much?,
,,,,,Aaah... It's because we don’t mind? Hehehe.,,
,,,,,,(So carefree...),
,,,,,You're spacing out again...,,
,,,,,Whatcha thinking about?,,
,,,,,,"Uh, oh. Nothing.",
,,,,,,"I was thinking, maybe I can help you with that.",
,,,,,"Heh! You don't have to, Jakey! I'm hunky-dory!",,
,,,,,,...,
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,,How are you feeling?,
,,,,,"Greeeat! No one's ever asked me how I'm feeling before, hahaha!",,
,,,,,,Even the Kasu?,
,,,,,Nopeee... They'd go straight back to their experiment.,,
,,,,,"No talk, all business!",,
,,,,,,That's harsh... Do they also do that to other succubi?,
,,,,,Huh. I've never really paid attention...,,
,,,,,Maybe since they mostly just use us.,,
,,,2-3-A,III-1,Are there any other side effects?,,
,,,,,,"Are there any other effects on your body? From their experiments, I mean.",
,,,,,Aah... maybe... *hic* trouble sleeping?,,
,,,,,Oh! I REMEMBER SOMETHING!,,
,,,,,,W- what is it?,
,,,,,,(I almost had a heart attack.),
,,,,,There was one time... one of our kind... destroyed a cave of a Cozbi...,,
,,,,,,What happened after that?,
,,,,,Well... I don't remember.,,
,,,,,"But, boy! Imagine the power she had to be able to do that!",,
,,,,,,That's scary...,
,,,2-3-B,III-3,Do you enjoy this?,,
,,,,,,Do you actually enjoy being experimented on like that?,
,,,,,"Not really... But as long as there's a... what was their name... Shyasta around, it's all good!",,
,,,,,,Shyasta?,
,,,,,They are soft... and comfortable... We love hugging them.,,
,,,,,,Soft and comfortable...,
,,,,,,...like a pillow?,
,,,,,They are our hug buddies!,,
,,,,,*hic* Get it? Hug buddies!,,
,,,,,,I- I understand.,
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,"Oh, Jake.",,
,,,,,What's up? Come in.,,
,,,,,,A- are you sober?,
,,,,,"Huh... I dunno, but my head hurts.",,
,,,,,,That's called a hangover...,
,,,,,I need a Shyasta so I can sleep.,,
,,,,,,Why?,
,,,,,It's comfortable to hug them...,,
,,,2-4-A,III-1,Do they mind?,,
,,,,,,Do they let you do that?,
,,,,,Some like to squirm when we sleep together...,,
,,,,,But most of them stay silent until we both fall asleep.,,
,,,,,,Sounds like they're bothered by it. Why don't you look for a new way to sleep?,
,,,,,I tried once and ended up bothering everyone.,,
,,,,,,What did you do?,
,,,,,I hugged everyone in sight and fell asleep on their bodies.,,
,,,,,,That's not what I meant.,
,,,,,"Jake, let's sleep.",,
,,,,,,"Wait, whoa-",
,,,,,(Zzz...),,
,,,,,,(She's hugging me real tight.),
,,,,,,(I hope she won't crush my body....),
,,,2-4-B,II-5,How about the other succubi?,,
,,,,,,What about the others?,
,,,,,Most of them run away from me. Only the Shyasta stay.,,
,,,,,,"They're like your best friends, then?",
,,,,,"Yes, and the best pillows.",,
,,,,,,Do you want me to buy you a pillow?,
,,,,,"No need, just come here.",,
,,,,,,What is-,
,,,,,,Ack!!!,
,,,,,Ssshh... Let me hug you.,,
,,,,,"Goodnight, Jake.",,
,,,,,,G- goodnight?,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,,Something has been bothering me.,
,,,,,"Huh? Is iiiit... my wings? It's my wings, isn't it?",,
,,,,,,"Whoa, hey.",
,,,,,,Why are you suddenly so insecure about your wings?,
,,,,,"Cuz a Shyasta said they're too *hic* shtuffy- I mean, stuffy. And pointy...",,
,,,,,oh...,,
,,,,,,"Speaking of the Shyasta, how come they're the only ones who can make you comfortable?",
,,,,,I dunno... Maybe it's because they are compact-sized?,,
,,,2-5-A,III-3,Do you trust them?,,
,,,,,,Maybe it's because you trust them...,
,,,,,Well... They only like to sleep... and they avoid conflict at all costs...,,
,,,,,"Iiiin short, they are super chill!",,
,,,,,It's nice being with them.,,
,,,,,,Does it mean that you also trust the Kasu?,
,,,,,"The Kasu, eh... Hmm... I think it's different...",,
,,,,,I don't feel as safe as when I'm with the Shyasta... I think.,,
,,,,,"Ugh, I hate thinking...",,
,,,,,,"O- okay, don't push yourself too hard.",
,,,2-5-B,II-3,Friendship with the Shyasta,,
,,,,,,I think there's more than just that.,
,,,,,What?,,
,,,,,,Maybe both of your kind have something in common.,
,,,,,,How did the friendship between your kind and theirs start?,
,,,,,Heheh...,,
,,,,,Hahahah!,,
,,,,,It's so simple! We don't talk!,,
,,,,,"We just hug, and sleep.",,
,,,,,,"You're right, that's IS simple.",
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,,You look more exhausted than usual.,
,,,,,,Do you want to rest today?,
,,,,,That's nonsense... I'm... as great as everrrr.,,
,,,,,,"No, you're not.",
,,,,,,Is this one of the effects of the Kasu's experiments?,
,,,,,Whatcha mean?,,
,,,,,,That you... become addicted to their engineered Carnal Essence?,
,,,,,,How long has it been since the last time they experimented on you?,
,,,,,I dumnoooo.... I never count the daaaaays....,,
,,,,,,"Well, you're too drunk to do that anyway.",
,,,,,Gee... I wish I could see them again.,,
,,,3-1-A,III-2,These side effects are bad for you.,,
,,,,,,"Even so, I still think you need to Stop consuming that much Essence.",
,,,,,,It's not good for you.,
,,,,,How is it not gooood?,,
,,,,,,You can't think clearly. You can barely move.,
,,,,,But... I know who you are... I know where I am...,,
,,,,,,"I mean, most of the time you don't realize what you're doing when you're drunk.",
,,,,,,And you can't control your strength...,
,,,,,Aaah... What should I doooo.,,
,,,,,,You can come and talk to me whenever something's bothering you.,
,,,,,Hmmm...I guess I could do that...,,
,,,3-1-B,EB,You're so clueless.,,
,,,,,,How can you be so clueless...,
,,,,,It's just who I am.,,
,,,,,,"You even let someone.... no, a whole group of succubi have their way with you.",
,,,,,They are just helping... I think...,,
,,,,,,But look at you now!,
,,,,,,You're an addict... You can't live without getting drunk.,
,,,,,"That's just the way it is, Jakey... There's no use in telling me what to do.",,
,,,,,,"I guess you're right, it's hopeless...",
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,,"Nocti, are you here-",
,,,,,Yoo-hoo!,,
,,,,,,"Ugh, this room reeks of booze. Have you been actually drinking?",
,,,,,Someone from the town gave me these.,,
,,,,,They taste awful... but they can make me drunk!,,
,,,,,...but only for a little while.,,
,,,,,,"Wait, those bottles... that's really strong liquor!",
,,,,,But not as strong as the Kasu's special Carnal Essence. Hahaha!,,
,,,3-2-A,EB,Maybe it's less harmful for you?,,
,,,,,,"But, since it's not as strong...",
,,,,,,Maybe it's less harmful for you?,
,,,,,*burp* Maybe?,,
,,,,,,"Perhaps, it can help wean you off your Carnal Essence addiction slowly...",
,,,,,Well... it can only make me drunk for a short while.,,
,,,,,"But, maybe, yeah...",,
,,,,,We can try?,,
,,,,,,Alright. Let's do this.,
,,,3-2-B,EA,You better stop for good.,,
,,,,,,"But you better not get addicted to booze, either.",
,,,,,But whyyyy?,,
,,,,,,You won't like it when you're having a hangover... or even amnesia...,
,,,,,Oh no... *hic* it's even worse than... *hic... Carnal Essence...,,
,,,,,,"As for the Carnal Essence, I think you need to stop that too.",
,,,,,,"Try to take less Carnal Essence, it's dangerous for you and for others around you.",
,,,,,"I see... *hic* then, I will try.",,
,,,,,,That's great.,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,,"Nocti, I need to talk to you about something.",
,,,,,Jake. What's up?,,
,,,,,,"Oh, are you sober?",
,,,,,,"This will be quick, then.",
,,,,,,"So, I've been thinking of some ways to cure your addiction.",
,,,,,Are you serious?,,
,,,,,How can you cure something that's been going on... for hundreds of years?,,
,,,3-3-A,III-4,Find someone you really trust.,,
,,,,,,How about being with someone you trust?,
,,,,,,"Like with you and the Shyasta. You're calmer when you're with them, right?",
,,,,,,"But now you should look for someone that you can not only trust, but that you can also talk to.",
,,,,,"The Shyasta are not a talkative kind, for sure...",,
,,,,,How about you?,,
,,,,,,M-m-me?,
,,,,,Uh huh. I feel content around you.,,
,,,,,,"If that's the case, then let's talk more often.",
,,,,,"Cool, but let me deal with this headache first.",,
,,,,,,I’ll help you with that.,
,,,3-3-B,III-2,Find something from the Human Realm.,,
,,,,,,Find comfort food here?,
,,,,,,We have tons of choices of food that you can try!,
,,,,,"But... unlike the Hala, we don't really consume anything from your realm.",,
,,,,,,"The Hala, huh.",
,,,,,"I can't say that they're connoisseurs, but...",,
,,,,,They really like to eat human food for some reason.,,
,,,,,,"If not food, then maybe drink?",
,,,,,Hmm... I dunno... Maybe you can just give me options...,,
,,,,,,I- I’ll try.,
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,I've been thinking about this a lot.,,
,,,,,,"Huh, that's a surprise.",
,,,,,"Well, that's rude... even if it's true.",,
,,,,,H- how do you know that you can trust someone?,,
,,,,,,Maybe it's when you can share your thoughts comfortably with them.,
,,,,,"Do you have someone? That you trust, I mean.",,
,,,,,,Of course. But she's not here anymore.,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,"Hahahaha! For a second, I thought it was me! Silly me!",,
,,,,,,Oh?,
,,,,,Anyway!,,
,,,,,Someone from the town gave me this bottle of... what do you call it?,,
,,,,,,That is liquor.,
,,,,,"Yeah, that. It tastes awful, but I feel great after drinking it!",,
,,,3-4-A,EA,Don’t drink that.,,
,,,,,,"Don't drink too much, it's harmful for your body... just like the Kasu's Carnal Essence.",
,,,,,Are you serioussss?,,
,,,,,,It can even cause temporary amnesia.,
,,,,,"Well, but... Maybe it can make me less addicted to Carnal Essence...?",,
,,,,,,I think it's my turn to ask you a question...,
,,,,,,"Nocti, do you trust me?",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,Yes...,,
,,,,,,"Good, throw it away.",
,,,,,But it's already empty anywayyyy.,,
,,,,,,"Then, don't drink any more of it, OK?",
,,,,,"Aye-aye, sir!",,
,,,3-4-B,EB,Alternative for Carnal Essence.,,
,,,,,,"Hmm, perhaps it could be an alternative for the Kasu's Carnal Essence?",
,,,,,"Yeaaah... I think so, too!",,
,,,,,,"Then, we should stock a lot of booze from now on.",
,,,,,Yay! You're the best!,,
,,,,,,(At least she won't harm or destroy anything for now...),
,,,,,,"Alright, we'll buy some booze while we're in town.",
,,,,,"Thank you, Jakey!",,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,EA,,,"Slowly but surely, Nocti left her drinking habits.",,
,,,,,All thanks to Jake's efforts to get her to live healthily.,,
,,,,,"Moreover, being with Jake makes Nocti feel all warm and cozy.",,
,,,,,She can sleep soundly with this man in her embrace.,,
,,EB,,,Nocti can no longer be satisfied by the pleasure Carnal Essence.,,
,,,,,Alcohol has become her only escape.,,
,,,,,"Stains can be found on nearly every surface, and a bottle of champagne is permanently in her hand.",,
,,,,,Now it's up to Jake to clean up her mess every time.,,
5,Ornia,I-1,,,Ornia,,
,,,,,"Aah, this place is so dull...",,
,,,,,"Oh, who is it?",,
,,,,,,Sorry for coming in so suddenly.,
,,,,,,Um... Do you perhaps need anything?,
,,,,,Hmm...,,
,,,,,Maybe you can come here and give me a manicure.,,
,,,,,,I'm not sure... can you teach me how to do it?,
,,,,,What a pain.,,
,,,,,Don't tell me you've never dealt with women before?,,
,,,1-1-A,I-3,Not sure about succubi,,
,,,,,,T- that's not it...,
,,,,,,Is it OK to treat you the same way as a human?,
,,,,,"If you're talking about my nails, then, yes, dummy.",,

,,,,,"Be quick, I want to go back to the Master's side again.",,
,,,1-2-A,II-1,The Master?,,

,,,,,,Okay...,
,,,,,Hmph.,,
,,,,,,,
,,,1-2-B,I-3,Zero points?,,

,,,,,You're funny!,,
,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,You have anything to say?,,
,,,,,,Eh? Nothing in particular...,
,,,,,Cuz you've been looking at me intensely for a while...,,
,,,,,Don't tell me you got enchanted by my beauty.,,

,,,,,You think you can buy me with that?,,
,,,,,"But... Yeah, we're the one and only type of succubus with these features.",,
,,,,,Be careful not to talk behind my back or I'll eat you right away!,,
,,,,,,I sure won't...,
,,,1-3-B,II-3,Talk about Luna,,

,,,,,,"W- well, if you want to tell me, then please do.",
,,,,,Huh? Now you're killing the mood.,,
,,,2-1-B,II-4,Would Luna like him too?,,

,,,,,,No! Not like that. I meant...,
,,,,,,If Luna were still here... I wonder if she'd like that type of man instead...,
,,,,,Who's that?,,
,,,,,,She... she's my late wife...,

,,,,,"She would, okay? Even other succubi swoon over him.",,
,,,,,,...,
,,II-2,,,,,

,,,2-3-B,III-3,My muse,,

,,,,,You're spending way too much time with the other Succubi.,,
,,,,,,Is that so? I didn't realize.,
,,,,,I'm getting lonely here.,,

,,,,,,You don't sound too sure.,
,,,2-4-B,III-4,Competing with other succubi.,,

,,,,,They are all boring!,,
,,,,,That's why you should just focus on me.,,

,,,,,Do you know what irritates me the mosI about them?,,
,,,,,It’s their audacity to proclaim themselves as the Master's Queen!,,
,,,,,,Wait... Do you mean that they are all like that?,
,,,,,"Insane, right?!",,
,,,,,But I believe the Master won’t fall into their trap.,,
,,,,,"After all, it’s not about appearances, But devotion!",,
,,,,,,(I thought that this one was already obsessed...),
,,,3-1-B,III-4,Aren’t they kinda similar to you?,,
,,,,,,"Basically, both you and them are both obsessed with the Master, right?",
,,,,,"Ew, don’t call it obsession!",,
,,,,,"Our love to the Master is pure, unlike theirs.",,
,,,,,I know they only want the throne.,,
,,,,,,"So, you don’t want it for yourself?",
,,,,,Nope! Being with Master alone already makes me happy.,,
,,,,,I can’t imagine how happy I'll be when he asks me out!,,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,,Ornia?,
,,,,,!!,,
,,,,,Don’t just barge into a lady's room like that! Have you no shame?,,
,,,,,,I knocked But you weren’t answering...,
,,,,,Hmm? You're worried about me?,,
,,,,,,"Well, how are you feeling?",
,,,,,I think I'll be fine if you tell me how good I am!,,
,,,3-2-A,EB,Praise her,,
,,,,,,So sudden- where should I start...,
,,,,,"Quick, quick!",,
,,,,,,For starters... I think no one beats your loyalty and sincerity.,
,,,,,,Even your jealousy... I find it adorable.,
,,,,,Teehee. You're making me blush!,,
,,,,,"If this goes on, I might fall for you, Jake.",,
,,,,,,"In that case, I'm honored.",
,,,,,"H- hey, stop taking things too seriously!",,
,,,3-2-B,III-3,She's really different,,
,,,,,,Hahah. You're really different from her.,
,,,,,What did I say about talking about other girls?,,
,,,,,,No... What I meant to say is...,
,,,,,,You’re truly unique.,
,,,,,,Even the simplest thing can make you happy.,
,,,,,,But I still don’t think it’s good to obsess over Someone...,
,,,,,"Hey, take a look in the mirror!",,
,,,,,Don’t you do that too?,,
,,,,,,...,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,"Feeling lonely, sweetie?",,
,,,,,,I’m just checking...,
,,,,,"Pfft, you think I'm your girlfriend?",,
,,,,,"But no one would send their girlfriend to do a dirty job, right?",,
,,,,,,I- it’s not like I want to...,
,,,,,,I have no other choice.,
,,,,,That’s why I told you we're not that different.,,
,,,3-3-A,EA,I realize it now,,
,,,,,,You make me realize now...,
,,,,,,All this time... Did I really do all of this out of love?,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,"Hey, since you already have me here, why don’t you just forget about her?",,
,,,,,,What do you mean?,
,,,,,Don’t play dumb.,,
,,,3-3-B,EB,This is true love,,
,,,,,,"But, if it’s for the one you love...",
,,,,,,"You must be willing to do anything, right...?",
,,,,,"Yep, I will do anything for the Master as well.",,
,,,,,"You know, you're not that bad, Jake.",,
,,,,,You said you really like my devotion. I guess you have it too!,,
,,,,,,I guess...,
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,,I’ve been thinking lately...,
,,,,,Oh? It’s rare seeing you opening up to me first.,,
,,,,,,Hmm... What is love for you?,
,,,,,...What?,,
,,,,,,F- forget it.,
,,,,,Pffff.. Ahahahahaha!,,
,,,,,I never thought you'd talk to me about this!,,
,,,,,,Ugh... That’s why I told you to forget about it.,
,,,,,"No, no. What is it that you want to talk about?",,
,,,3-4-A,III-3,Your love with the Master,,
,,,,,,"You love the Master, right?",
,,,,,Well of course.,,
,,,,,,If he suddenly disappeared from your life... what would you do?,
,,,,,I’d rather die!,,
,,,,,,"If you're given a chance to See him again, would you take it?",
,,,,,Duh. You don’t have to ask!,,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,What was that? You weirdo.,,
,,,3-4-B,EA,To like another person,,
,,,,,,Do you think it’s okay to like another person...,
,,,,,,...When you can’t be with your true love?,
,,,,,Your true love... That Luna girl?,,
,,,,,,Yes...,
,,,,,"Hmph, how should I know? You have to decide that for yourself.",,
,,,,,But if I were that girl...,,
,,,,,I’d be pissed off if I hear that the man I love is still thinking about other women!,,
,,,,,,Is that so...,
,,,,,,Ahahah.,
,,,,,W- what are you laughing at!,,
,,EA,,,"Although she is the exact opposite of his wife, Jake is overjoyed with Ornia by his side.",,
,,,,,The playful Ornia made Jake's days filled with laughter.,,
,,,,,The same goes for her. Life with Jake has been nothing but exciting.,,
,,,,,Her obsession towards the Demon King has become a thing of the past.,,
,,EB,,,"In the end, it's only two of them.",,
,,,,,"Jake still pictures Luna, never seeing Ornia for who she really is.",,
,,,,,"And just like Jake, Ornia cannot forget about the Demon King.",,
,,,,,"Both are engulfed by their devotion, but sandly, not for each other.",,
6,Luzbel,,,,Luzbel,,
,,I-1,,,,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,Is there something wrong with my face?,,
,,,,,,It’s my first time seeing a Succubus with glasses.,
,,,,,,What’s with them anyway? I thought all succubi have perfect vision.,
,,,,,I just happen to love reading books.,,
,,,,,"Besides, just because I'm wearing glasses, doesn’t mean that I can’t do things well.",,
,,,1-1-A,II-3,I guess not everyone is perfect.,,
,,,,,,"I guess nobody's perfect, then... even demons.",
,,,,,Hmph. Seems like you really want to test me?,,
,,,,,,"N- no, that’s not what I mean.",
,,,,,"I know, I was just joking.",,
,,,,,,It... didn’t sound like you were joking.,
,,,,,Sorry about that.,,
,,,1-1-B,I-2,It’s always good to better yourself.,,
,,,,,,"I guess it’s necessary for ss to better ourselves, even by using tools.",
,,,,,"Yes, I agree.",,
,,,,,We need to absorb all kinds of knowledge to better ourselves.,,
,,,,,Yet some have been declared forbidden.,,
,,,,,,"(Forbidden knowledge... Like summoning succubus, perhaps?)",
,,I-2,,,,,
,,,,,,That book..,
,,,,,You're interested?,,
,,,,,"I like to take notes, so it’s always by my side.",,
,,,,,,You're really diligent.,
,,,,,It’s just a hobby of mine.,,
,,,1-2-A,II-3,The book Is pretty useful.,,
,,,,,,"That book sure comes in handy, in that case.",
,,,,,II is. You can store your knowledge inside such thin paper.,,
,,,,,"I rarely see you read any books, though.",,
,,,,,,I... I don’t really have the time...,
,,,,,I can recommend you some good ones.,,
,,,,,,"Books... Like, human books?",
,,,,,"Yes. I read many kinds of books, including your kind's.",,
,,,,,,"That’s amazing, especially for a succubus.",
,,,1-2-B,II-1,It's kind of weird.,,
,,,,,,It's kind of weird seeing a succubus always carrying a book around.,
,,,,,"Contrary to what humans fantasize about us, we're not mere sex-craving demons.",,
,,,,,"We are all unique, just like you.",,
,,,,,Our own needs and wants.,,
,,,,,,"Ah! S- sorry, I didn’t mean it like that...",
,,,,,Maybe I should write a book about succubi for you to read.,,
,,,,,,"You don’t have to go that far... but, thank you...",
,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,Good day.,,
,,,,,What shall I do today?,,
,,,,,,"Ah... Oh! I’ll.. I'll share with you later, is that okay?",
,,,,,Why do you look so surprised?,,
,,,,,Is there any problem?,,
,,,,,,No... It’s just that you're kind of different from other succubi.,
,,,,,,"The way you talk, I mean...",
,,,,,I don’t think that there's anything wrong with the way I talk.,,
,,,1-3-A,II-1,You sound really polite.,,
,,,,,,How do I say this...,
,,,,,,"You're really polite, I guess?",
,,,,,It’s just the way I communicate.,,
,,,,,,"Y- yeah, I didn’t mean it in a bad way.",
,,,,,"Good, then.",,
,,,1-3-B,I-2,No problem with that.,,
,,,,,,I guess there's no problem with that.,
,,,,,Really?,,
,,,,,,"Yeah, it’s your personality.",
,,,,,,I’ll just need a little more time to get used to it.,
,,,,,I see...,,
,,II-1,,,,,
,,,,,,"Um, I have something to ask, if you don’t mind.",
,,,,,Go on.,,
,,,,,,"I heard that you all have a new ruler, right?",
,,,,,"Why yes, he's the son of the Demon Queen.",,
,,,,,Which makes him the rightful heir.,,
,,,2-1-A,II-3,Your kind is still using a monarchy?,,
,,,,,,"So, that means... your kind is still using a monarchy?",
,,,,,That is true.,,
,,,,,,Even though you guys have lived for thousands of years...,
,,,,,You have a problem with that?,,
,,,,,,"I- I’m sorry, I mean it’s kind of old-fashioned, isn’t it?",
,,,,,"We do keep our traditions, at least as long as the leader says so.",,
,,,,,,I see.,
,,,2-1-B,II-2,"So, it’s a matter of leadership.",,
,,,,,,"I see, so it’s a matter of leadership, then?",
,,,,,"Yes, after all, we hope the best from our leader.",,
,,,,,,"Of course, a competent leader is important after all.",
,,,,,How do humans choose their leader in this era?,,
,,,,,,II varies... But plenty of us vote for ours.,
,,,,,"Democratic, huh? That’s incredible.",,
,,,,,I might want to observe more.,,
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,,Asmodeus..,
,,,,,Why do you suddenly speak of His Highness' name?,,
,,,,,,"Oh, it just crossed my mind.",
,,,,,,"I’ve met many kinds of succubi, but it seems like all of you have different views regarding him.",
,,,,,"Hmph, well, we have our own stories.",,
,,,,,While some quickly accepted him as their leader...,,
,,,,,There were others who took longer.,,
,,,,,,"What about you, then?",
,,,,,I have no Problem with him.,,
,,,2-2-A,III-1,He must be so charismatic.,,
,,,,,,He must be charismatic if you're willing to follow him.,
,,,,,I’ve told you he is the rightful heir of our Queen.,,
,,,,,It’s only natural to follow him.,,
,,,,,,But... what if he turns out... incompetent?,
,,,,,That is not for you to decide.,,
,,,,,,A- alright...,
,,,2-2-B,III-1,"It's not like I have any problem with him, but..",,
,,,,,,"I think it’s better if you follow yourself and stick with the other succubi, like us humans.",
,,,,,You mean it’s wrong to follow the leader?,,
,,,,,,"Yes. If a leader is incompetent, sometimes you have to trust in yourself instead.",
,,,,,,Believe in your heart.,
,,,,,I see... I guess this is what makes humans... human.,,
,,,,,,What do you mean?,
,,,,,"Nothing, just talking to myself.",,
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,,By the way...,
,,,,,What is it this time?,,
,,,,,,"Umm, where did you get your glasses?",
,,,,,You are one curious human. I like that.,,
,,,,,"The custom began with our ancestors, back when they were visiting the Human Realm.",,
,,,2-3-A,II-4,Your ancestors learned from us?,,
,,,,,,"Wow, so your ancestors learned from us?",
,,,,,"More or less. Our kind love to exchange ideas, even with humans.",,
,,,,,,I believe it was terrific.,
,,,,,"Yes it was, just like now...",,
,,,,,,What do you mean?,
,,,,,Your suggestions are simple and often come in handy.,,
,,,,,I like that.,,
,,,,,,Ah... Thank you.,
,,,2-3-B,III-1,No magical solution for bad vision?,,
,,,,,,"But... as demons, don’t you have some kind of magical solution?",
,,,,,,"Rather than wearing glasses, I mean.",
,,,,,"No, we like your solution. It is simple and effective.",,
,,,,,And uses less of our power.,,
,,,,,,I see...,
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,"Oh, you're writing again.",
,,,,,Yes.,,
,,,,,,"What are you writing, if I may ask?",
,,,,,About humans.,,
,,,2-4-A,III-3,What caught your interest?,,
,,,,,,Oh? What caught your interest?,
,,,,,This thing called ‘marriage.’,,
,,,,,A ceremony where couples make an oath to stay together for life.,,
,,,,,It’s interesting how humans believe in only one partner for life.,,
,,,,,,Just like me and Luna...,
,,,,,Hm? What’s wrong.,,
,,,,,Yes.,,
,,,,,,II’s... nothing.,
,,,,,"Okay, then.",,
,,,2-4-B,II-5,Are we that interesting?,,
,,,,,,Compared to your kind... I don’t think we're that interesting.,
,,,,,Hmph. According to my observations...,,
,,,,,Humans are particularly unique compared to other creatures.,,
,,,,,,How so...?,
,,,,,"Sometimes you can be kind and caring, But at other times Very annoying.",,
,,,,,"This conflicting mix of qualities is rare, at least in my experience.",,
,,,,,,I- is that so...,
,,,,,,I’ll try to be more caring then.,
,,,,,Just be yourself. That’s what makes you human.,,
,,,,,,Okay.,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,,"Luzbel, what are you doing?",
,,,,,"Writing, as usual. What brings you here?",,
,,,,,,I just wanted to Visit.,
,,,,,,Are you writing about humans again?,
,,,,,Humans are an interesting subject. We've been observing your kind for a long time.,,
,,,,,"However, since Master Asmodeus' ascension...",,
,,,,,We haven’t been to the Human Realm.,,
,,,,,,"No wonder you're always writing, we must have changed a lot since then.",
,,,,,Indeed.,,
,,,2-5-A,III-3,You should visit us more often.,,
,,,,,,"I think your kind should visit our realm more often, so we could learn from each other.",
,,,,,I completely agree. There are so many things that I find peculiar.,,
,,,,,,You bet.,
,,,,,,Perhaps we could exchange some ideas?,
,,,,,,It could be about anything.,
,,,,,Much obliged.,,
,,,2-5-B,III-1,Do you have to do that?,,
,,,,,,But... do you think it’s really important to learn about humanity?,
,,,,,We might be able to exchange ideas...,,
,,,,,Just like my ancestors.,,
,,,,,,I don’t know if it’s good in the long run...,
,,,,,Why do you sound skeptical?,,
,,,,,,"I mean, we are so different.",
,,,,,"In terms of communication, it won’t always be smooth.",,
,,,,,I suppose you humans should know about this.,,
,,,,,,"Yes, and That’s what I'm afraid of.",
,,,,,Why?,,
,,,,,,It could lead to conflict...,
,,,,,"Oh, afraid of us, are you?",,
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,I have a question for you this time.,,
,,,,,,"Sure, ask away.",
,,,,,How are the rules made in the Human Realm?,,
,,,,,,They're usually regulated by each country's leader or government.,
,,,,,,"And, as you may know, if we break the laws, we will get caught by the authorities.",
,,,,,"I see, so it’s also strict in the human realm.",,
,,,3-1-A,III-2,Do you want to learn more?,,
,,,,,,Do you want to know more about it?,
,,,,,By any means.,,
,,,,,,"Sure, I'll find time to talk more about it with you.",
,,,,,"Sure, But I can’t do it right now, I'm afraid...",,
,,,,,"What a shame... then, next time?",,
,,,,,,Of course.,
,,,3-1-B,EB,Perhaps we have different rules?,,
,,,,,,"It might be different in the Demon Realm, right?",
,,,,,,I don’t think we could follow the system there...,
,,,,,Don’t judge too quickly.,,
,,,,,,It’s just... It might be harsher there?,
,,,,,Maybe you should listen to what others have to say first before opening your mouth.,,
,,,,,"Go away, I'm not in the mood to argue.",,
,,,,,,Wait-,
,,,,,,(I shouldn’t have said that.),
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,You're here.,,
,,,,,Shall we continue our conversation from the last time?,,
,,,,,,Oh! Sure. What do you want to know?,
,,,,,You mentioned something about getting caught by the authorities.,,
,,,,,"Other than that, are there other consequences for rule breakers?",,
,,,,,,Well...,
,,,3-2-A,EB,To face death.,,
,,,,,,They could face death. Some countries do have the death penalty...,
,,,,,Really?,,
,,,,,,"Yes, it’s really important to follow the rules.",
,,,,,,Don’t you think so?,
,,,,,I suppose so...,,
,,,3-2-B,EB,I’m not sure.,,
,,,,,,I'm just a lowly citizen in this place.,
,,,,,,I'm afraid I can’t answer that...,
,,,,,I thought the rules of men should be known to all humans?,,
,,,,,,"Yes, but I don’t know anything more than that...",
,,,,,That’s a shame then...,,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,Seems like you have gone through that thing.,,
,,,,,,That thing?,
,,,,,That... marriage thing.,,
,,,,,I still don’t understand anything about it.,,
,,,,,Can you tell me more about this?,,
,,,,,,Well...,
,,,3-3-A,III-4,The important thing about marriage is...,,
,,,,,,What’s important is for the couple to love each other.,
,,,,,,To the point that they are willing to spend the rest of their lives together.,
,,,,,Hmm...,,
,,,,,How about those couples who are forced to perform this ceremony?,,
,,,,,,I think... those are the bad examples of marriage.,
,,,,,,I think marriage should be based on love.,
,,,,,"Love, huh.",,
,,,3-3-B,EB,Marriage is sacred.,,
,,,,,,"In my opinion, marriage is something sacred... but many fail to see it that way.",
,,,,,Like what?,,
,,,,,,"Like forced marriage, for example.",
,,,,,"I see, so marriage can also be a terrible thing?",,
,,,,,,More or less.,
,,,,,I see.,,
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,,"Hi, Luzbel.",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,Luzbel?,
,,,,,"Oh, what is it?",,
,,,,,,Why are you spacing out?,
,,,,,This thing that is foreign to us...,,
,,,,,,Do you want to tell me about it? Maybe I can help.,
,,,,,"Well... Jake, what is love?",,
,,,,,,Huh?,
,,,,,"We’ve been talking about things related to love these past few days, but what exactly is love?",,
,,,,,,"It’s, um...",
,,,3-4-A,EA,You can feel butterflies inside your stomach.,,
,,,,,,Love is... seeing your special person and you feel like you have butterflies in your stomach.,
,,,,,,Just like with my late wife...,
,,,,,Your late wife had butterflies inside her stomach? Is that how she died?,,
,,,,,,N- not literally.,
,,,,,,"Ahem, I mean it’s an amazing feeling...",
,,,,,,So amazing that you feel like the whole world seems so bright and beautiful.,
,,,,,I see...,,
,,,,,,Seems like you still have a lot to learn from us.,
,,,,,"Yes, I agree.",,
,,,,,Can you tell me more about this kind of feeling?,,
,,,,,,Sure.,
,,,3-4-B,EB,It makes you obsessed.,,
,,,,,,It could make you obsessed...,
,,,,,,"When you lose your loved one, it could drive you mad...",
,,,,,,"You miss them like crazy. The grief, the pain... It’s like nothing you've ever felt before.",
,,,,,I see...,,
,,,,,It’s a scary feeling.,,
,,,,,,It’s beautiful... but it can be frightening when you lose it.,
,,,,,I get it.,,
,,EA,,,Luzbel thought that she would face a lot of trouble when she became human.,,
,,,,,"To her surprise, her new life with Jake is going well.",,
,,,,,"Now that she gets to experience being a human herself, she no longer needs her book...",,
,,EB,,,Luzbel never thought that she would turn into a human.,,
,,,,,She indeed wished to learn more about them...,,
,,,,,But she only knew how to live as a succubus.,,
,,,,,"Confused and filled with regret, she now spends all her time looking for a way to turn back into a succubus.",,
7,Kasu,I-1,,,Kasu,,
,,,,,I can smell the presence of succubi here...,,
,,,,,,Smell?,
,,,,,,How can you smell their presence?,
,,,,,The sweet smell of their Carnal Essence... it lingers!,,
,,,,,,(She can smell Carnal Essence?),
,,,,,"They are here, aren't they? Let me meet them!",,
,,,1-1-A,II-3,The smell of Carnal Essence.,,
,,,,,,Does Carnal Essence leave a scent? I didn't know that.,
,,,,,"When you work with it your whole life, you learn its scent.",,
,,,,,,You mean... when you absorb it from human men?,
,,,,,"Nah, that's basic. What I do is experiment with it.",,
,,,,,,Experiment?,
,,,,,Yes.,,
,,,,,"In fact, since you seem used to summoning succubi...",,
,,,,,Can I borrow them some time?,,
,,,,,,B- borrow? What do you want to do with them?!,
,,,,,Don't you worry! I'm an expert!,,
,,,,,,I think I'll have to pass on that...,
,,,1-1-B,I-2,Any business with them?,,
,,,,,,Why? Do you have some business with them?,
,,,,,No... I just want to check on them.,,
,,,,,I've got lots of questions about their experiences here...,,
,,,,,,"You're a curious one, aren't you?",
,,,,,"Why, yes I am.",,
,,,,,Especially when it comes to the science of Carnal Essence.,,
,,,,,,(There are stars in her eyes every time she talks about Carnal Essence.),
,,I-2,,,,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,"Come on in, I don't bite.",,
,,,,,What's up?,,
,,,,,,I'm just checking up on you.,
,,,,,,"Well, then...",
,,,,,"So soon? Come take a look at my work first, will you?",,
,,,,,,What's that? It's glowing...,
,,,,,"Pretty, isn’t it? It's crystalized Carnal Essence that I made myself!",,
,,,,,"I deserve a round of applause, making this work of art with such shoddy equipment.",,
,,,1-2-A,II-1,You’re used to doing this?,,
,,,,,,"Creating these in such a short amount of time... you must be used to doing this, right?",
,,,,,"An excellent observation. As a reward, let me tell you what it's for!",,
,,,,,These crystals are used for experimental testing on succubi's bodies.,,
,,,,,,Come again?!,
,,,,,"There’re tons of hidden potential in Carnal Essence, you Know.",,
,,,,,,A-are those succubi OK?,
,,,,,"You aren't listening, are you?",,
,,,,,"They're fine! We're demons, remember?",,
,,,,,We're not fragile little humans.,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,1-2-B,II-3,It can be crystalized?,,
,,,,,,I didn't know that Carnal Essence could be crystalized.,
,,,,,"Awesome, right? It took us hundreds of years to find out how to do this!",,
,,,,,,"You mean, all of your kind are like you?",
,,,,,We are a curious bunch.,,
,,,,,Everything for science!,,
,,,,,,Demonic science?,
,,,,,Call it whatever you like.,,
,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,,Kasu...?,
,,,,,"Oh, perfect timing.",,
,,,,,Strip. Now.,,
,,,,,,Excuse me?!,
,,,,,I wish to see your insides.,,
,,,,,,W- wait a minute! You can't do that!,
,,,,,Why can't I?,,
,,,1-3-A,II-4,Why me?,,
,,,,,,"Why me, though?",
,,,,,You smell different from other men.,,
,,,,,I can smell the Carnal Essence of succubi on you.,,
,,,,,,What do you mean...?,
,,,,,Don't play dumb. Just strip so I can dissect you.,,
,,,,,,No!,
,,,,,Tch. Lend me a succubus of yours then.,,
,,,,,,I can't do that either!,
,,,,,So stingy...,,
,,,1-3-B,I-2,What do you want to do?,,
,,,,,,Just what exactly are you trying to do?,
,,,,,I want to learn about Carnal Essence.,,
,,,,,"Yours, to be precise.",,
,,,,,"Now, be a good boy and lay down on the bed, will you?",,
,,,,,,N- no way. You said that you'd cut me open-,
,,,,,It won't hurt. I'm an expert.,,
,,,,,,No...,
,,,,,"You're a tough One, aren't you?",,
,,,,,"Well, there's always next time.",,
,,,,,,(She’s really weird.),
,,II-1,,,,,
,,,,,,It's still early in the morning and you already look busy.,
,,,,,"Carnal Essence research. Keeps me busy, busy, busy!",,
,,,,,"I You know, there's this effect that really intrigues me...",,
,,,,,,W- what would that be?,
,,,,,My Carnal Essence can make succubi drunk.,,
,,,,,,Drunk? Like drunk from booze?,
,,,,,Bingo. With the side effect of massively amplifying their physical strength.,,
,,,,,I'm sure now that Carnal Essence can provide so much more than just sustenance for us succubi...,,
,,,2-1-A,II-2,About your kind...,,
,,,,,,Are you the only one doing this research into Carnal Essence?,
,,,,,Mmm? Nope! My kind are all into this stuff.,,
,,,,,The pursuit of knowledge! Science! It runs in our blood!,,
,,,,,,But is that pursuit limited to just Carnal Essence?,
,,,,,Nooope. Carnal Essence just happens to be the most compelling subject for us.,,
,,,,,You don't want to ask why?,,
,,,,,,(Those starry eyes again.),
,,,,,,Er... Why?,
,,,,,"Because there's a possibility it doesn't just affect us succubi. It may affect humans, too!",,
,,,,,Have you ever seen a human overflowing with Carnal Essence?,,
,,,,,"Their physical appearance changes! Why, that could only be explained by...",,
,,,,,,(There's no stopping her once she starts lecturing...),
,,,2-1-B,III-4,You're like a human alchemist.,,
,,,,,,You remind me of Master Warlock...,
,,,,,Master Warlock? Who's that?,,
,,,,,,A great alchemist from the Human Realm.,
,,,,,,He's famous for his process of homunculi creation.,
,,,,,Are you serious? Someone figured out how to create life from nothing?!,,
,,,,,"That one is an unparalleled genius! He must be the most talented human alive... No, in history!",,
,,,,,,Too bad nobody knows where he is today.,
,,,,,,Nor does anyone know if he's even still alive.,
,,,,,"Noted. Unfortunate, but this does give me some interest in learning alchemy...",,
,,,,,Its secrets may just be the push my experiments need.,,
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,,Your experiments...,
,,,,,What about them?,,
,,,,,,Since you said that it affects both succubi and humans...,
,,,,,,Have you ever used a human test subject?,
,,,,,"Well, no.",,
,,,,,But succubi... Ohohoho. Yes indeed!,,
,,,2-2-A,II-5,Who are those succubi?,,
,,,,,,Are you for real?,
,,,,,"Good sir, I would never jest about science! Luckily for me, some succubi are very cooperative.",,
,,,,,,They... willingly become your test subjects?!,
,,,,,I've told you that my Carnal Essence causes... what is it called in your realm...,,
,,,,,Alcohol intoxication?,,
,,,,,"Well, apparently the Nocti kind can't get drunk enough!",,
,,,,,,"So, they let you experiment on them in exchange for... getting smashed?",
,,,,,"A win-win for the both of us, no?",,
,,,,,,Isn't that dangerous for them? They can't possibly live their lives while intoxicated.,
,,,,,Hmph! I'll have you know there hasn't been even one serious incident... yet.,,
,,,2-2-B,III-1,For the sake of your own self-interest?,,
,,,,,,Are you doing this because you want to?,
,,,,,Duh. What could be more fulfilling than a life spent unlocking the secrets of existence?,,
,,,,,"It's all thanks to our new leader, too.",,
,,,,,"He's funding our research. Science needs moolah, you know!",,
,,,,,,Funding?,
,,,,,Yep. The Master is quite interested in the potential of Carnal Essence.,,
,,,,,"As such, my kind are provided with everything we need!",,
,,,,,,I see...,
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,"I wish I could work on a Nocti, right here and now.",,
,,,,,,A Nocti?,
,,,,,"A kind of succubi... Real strong ones, those Nocti.",,
,,,,,"By strong, I mean quite resilient.",,
,,,,,"No matter what I try on them, they just keep on coming back for more!",,
,,,,,,Are they masochists?,
,,,,,,Or maybe your kind bribes them?,
,,,,,"Well, that's rude of you.",,
,,,,,"Can't say the other kinds are exactly willing to be made into subjects, however.",,
,,,2-3-A,II-5,Other succubi you experimented on.,,
,,,,,,There are other kinds of succubi you've experimented on?,
,,,,,"Of course! After all, each kind has their own unique characteristics.",,
,,,,,"Aside from the Nocti, the Hala are simple to persuade.",,
,,,,,All I need is some human food and they'll do whatever I tell them to! Isn't it marvelous?,,
,,,,,,You kind of sound more like a villain than a researcher...,
,,,,,"Hey! I do warn them to expect some... side effects, after having their bodies worked on.",,
,,,,,And they've always agreed to the terms. I'm not liable for anything! Hehehe.,,
,,,2-3-B,III-3,Are you allowed to do that?,,
,,,,,,Are you allowed to conduct experiments on fellow succubi?,
,,,,,,"I mean, does your new ruler even approve of this?",
,,,,,Approval-schmoval. Who cares?!,,
,,,,,"However, if you're really concerned, then yes. Master Asmodeus himself has given his express approval.",,
,,,,,"He really, really wants to see Some results from all this research into Carnal Essence!",,
,,,,,,I wonder if all those succubi are okay...,
,,,,,"You worry too much. Like I always tell them: ""Steel yourself woman, this is for science!""",,
,,,,,Unless you want me to... demonstrate my technique? Here and now?,,
,,,,,,I’ll pass.,
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,,"Kasu, are you here-",
,,,,,,Holy Celestials! What's happening here?!,
,,,,,Carnal Essence crystallization. Pretty simple.,,
,,,,,,Why is there blood everywhere?!,
,,,,,Will you relax? It's from this dead guy.,,
,,,,,"I was performing a dissection, examining the Carnal Essence within his body.",,
,,,,,,Dissecting a corpse for its Carnal Essence?,
,,,,,"Science means getting your hands dirty, you know?",,
,,,2-4-A,III-1,Where does that determination come from?,,
,,,,,,Why are you so determined to do this?,
,,,,,I recommend walking straight to your closest apothecary and asking for their strongest dose of chill pills.,,
,,,,,,"Does Master Asmodeus not mind you doing this? I mean, these are your fellow succubi...",
,,,,,"Nopity-nope-nope! He's waaay more relaxed about this than you are, actually.",,
,,,,,The hidden potential in Carnal Essence is just too great a reward to ignore!,,
,,,,,,This is wrong... You're treating your fellow succubi like guinea pigs...,
,,,,,I think of them as necessary sacrifices in the name of progress.,,
,,,2-4-B,III-4,Studying Other things about humans.,,
,,,,,,"But, you love learning about many other things, right?",
,,,,,"I want to learn EVERYTHING, to be precise.",,
,,,,,,Don't you want to learn more about humans?,
,,,,,The idea does tickle me... but I don't even know where to start.,,
,,,,,,"You can start by, uh, observing some humans? Studying their behavior?",
,,,,,,That would definitely help in learning to understand us.,
,,,,,"But, my Carnal Essence research...",,
,,,,,,"Maybe when you understand us, you can find a more... effective way to dissect Carnal Essence?",
,,,,,Hmm... Not a bad idea.,,
,,,,,,Right?,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,,"Kasu, I've been wondering...",
,,,,,What is it?,,
,,,,,,"Your test subjects... They all gave their consent to this, right?",
,,,,,Mostly.,,
,,,,,,... Mostly?,
,,,,,"I've told you that some actually enjoy being experimented on, right?",,
,,,,,"As long as they don't mind, you don't need to worry your sweet little head about it.",,
,,,2-5-A,III-1,About your methods...,,
,,,,,,Does your ruler not mind you tricking the other succubi like that?,
,,,,,Tricking them? Perish the thought!,,
,,,,,"Besides, the Master only cares about results.",,
,,,,,,"That sounds kind of irresponsible, if you ask me.",
,,,,,"Details, details. All that matters is that I get everything I need for my research.",,
,,,,,Having our ruler funding the whole thing makes life so much easier for us!,,
,,,2-5-B,III-4,They are kind of similar to humans.,,
,,,,,,From how you explain it...,
,,,,,,Succubi are kind of similar to humans.,
,,,,,How so?,,
,,,,,,Some of us can be tricked into taking shady deals too easily.,
,,,,,But those are the kind of subjects I love the most!,,
,,,,,,Huh?,
,,,,,They make such good test subjects. I can do virtually anything to them!,,
,,,,,,"(For the sake of my peace, I better not continue this conversation.)",
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,Grr...,,
,,,,,,... Huh?,
,,,,,,"It's rare to see you upset, what's up?",
,,,,,I can't find it!,,
,,,,,,Find what?,
,,,,,A way to turn a succubus into a human...,,
,,,,,"I've heard that when it happens, the former succubus can produce twice the amount of Carnal Essence.",,
,,,,,,Who told you that?,
,,,,,Master Asmodeus.,,
,,,,,He wants me to discover exactly how that process works.,,
,,,3-1-A,III-2,The result so far?,,
,,,,,,How's your research going?,
,,,,,,"You must already have something, right?",
,,,,,"Hearsay isn't science, but I've heard from another succubi...",,
,,,,,"A succubus needs to enter a certain ""pact"" in order to become human.",,
,,,,,"A Love Pact, they said.",,
,,,,,,"A Love Pact, huh....",
,,,,,,"So, it requires two parties? It IS a pact and all...",
,,,,,Maybe? I don't have enough information about it.,,
,,,,,I'm looking for other possible answers though.,,
,,,,,,Sounds complicated...,
,,,3-1-B,III-3,Win-win solution for us.,,
,,,,,,"In that case, this looks like a possible win-win situation for us.",
,,,,,"Huh?! Elaborate, human.",,
,,,,,,"Well, I, uh... summoned you here to help me.",
,,,,,,"And while you're here, you can work on your research more freely. So, this could be... Uh...",
,,,,,"Pfft. So, you do have a bit of cunning in you, Jake.",,
,,,,,,I- I didn't mean to put it like that...,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,"Hello, Kasu?",
,,,,,Ah. It's you.,,
,,,,,"You know, I witnessed a wedding yesterday while I was out on the town, observing people.",,
,,,,,,Oh? Could you be...,
,,,,,Why are you looking at me like that?,,
,,,,,,N- nothing. Sorry.,
,,,,,,What's on your mind?,
,,,,,Maybe a Love Pact... should be made between a succubus and a human.,,
,,,,,Just like a human marriage.,,
,,,3-2-A,EB,How did your observation go?,,
,,,,,,And? What else did you learn from your observations?,
,,,,,Seems like there is no significant change in their Carnal Essence production.,,
,,,,,Bummer.,,
,,,,,,Maybe you need to experience love yourself.,
,,,,,"And just what might you be proposing there, Jake?",,
,,,,,,I just think that it might take more than just a vow with words...,
,,,,,Hmm...,,
,,,3-2-B,EA,Love is what makes us human.,,
,,,,,,That could be true.,
,,,,,,Since love is what makes us human.,
,,,,,Aren't you already human?,,
,,,,,,T- that's not what I meant.,
,,,,,"Hmm, this is frustrating.",,
,,,,,I refuse for there to be a concept I cannot understand...,,
,,,,,,"C- cheer up, you have plenty of time to learn about everything.",
,,,,,Not if I get turned into human.,,
,,,,,,Huh?,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,,How did you conduct your research back in your realm?,
,,,,,"Oh?! Getting curious now, are we?",,
,,,,,,I'm just wondering...,
,,,,,"Well, we hopped back and forth between the two realms.",,
,,,,,,Just to get Carnal Essence?,
,,,,,"A time-consuming process, I admit.",,
,,,,,But a small price for the advancement of knowledge.,,
,,,,,,That's a dedicated scientist for you.,
,,,,,"There are just so many things to study, and not enough time to learn them all...",,
,,,3-3-A,III-4,Any personal projects?,,
,,,,,,Do you have any personal projects going on?,
,,,,,Tons.,,
,,,,,"Thing is, I hardly have the time, what with the Master's orders and all...",,
,,,,,"Plus, he is really eager to see the results of our Carnal Essence research.",,
,,,,,,Do you think...,
,,,,,,He wants to use that knowledge to better the life of the succubi?,
,,,,,I really don't know.,,
,,,,,Not that I particularly care either. As long as I get to indulge in my research...,,
,,,,,,... then you don't mind what comes after.,
,,,,,"Stealing my Sentences now, are we?",,
,,,,,,Hahaha!,
,,,3-3-B,EB,Your ruler's order.,,
,,,,,,But I think it's better to prioritize your ruler's orders.,
,,,,,,I mean... he's your boss.,
,,,,,Obviously.,,
,,,,,It's not as if I don't want to do this.,,
,,,,,,"Ah, but has he ever told you to conduct research on anything else?",
,,,,,No. He specifically only wants to learn about Carnal Essence.,,
,,,,,,I see...,
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,"You know, Jake... I've been following your advice.",,
,,,,,,What advice?,
,,,,,"Ah, you humans. So forgetful!",,
,,,,,"You told me to learn more about the human world, remember?",,
,,,,,,"Oh... I did, didn't I?",
,,,,,,"So, how is it going?",
,,,,,Well. Turns out humanity encompasses quite a multitude of subjects.,,
,,,,,I'm having a hard time choosing a topic to focus on.,,
,,,3-4-A,EB,Human relationships.,,
,,,,,,How about human relationships? They're pretty interesting.,
,,,,,"Ah. Well. Uh, social interaction isn't exactly my forte...",,
,,,,,I'd rather go back to my Carnal Essence research.,,
,,,,,At least I was making progress there.,,
,,,,,,"Well, that's a shame.",
,,,3-4-B,EA,Human alchemy.,,
,,,,,,How about alchemy? Have you taken a look at it?,
,,,,,"Ah, but of course!",,
,,,,,"I've been reading up a ton on homunculi. Their creation, their usage...",,
,,,,,,"Well, you can just focus on that, then.",
,,,,,,I'm certainly Seeing Stars in your eyes.,
,,,,,Heh. Hehehe. I won't deny my enthusiasm.,,
,,,,,"I've read Master Warlock's journal, too, you know.",,
,,,,,He could even make humanoid homunculi... Dozens of them!,,
,,,,,Incredible.,,
,,,,,,(Wait. Where did she get all those books and materials?),
,,EA,,,Jake always has the most interesting stuff to share with Kasu.,,
,,,,,"She mostly spends time in her lab, but nowadays she's really into learning practical alchemy.",,
,,,,,"It's fascinating to create an artificial life, together with her beloced.",,
,,,,,Both of them treat their homunculi like their own children.,,
,,EB,,,Jake thought that Kasu finally became interested in human knowledge.,,
,,,,,"However, that is not the case, as she's actually still engrossed with researching Carnal Essence.",,
,,,,,She even deliberately uses Jake as her test subject.,,
,,,,,Everyday begins with her cutting him open again and again in another new experiment.,,
8,Lamia,I-1,,,Lamia,,
,,,,,Ewww... disgusting!,,
,,,,,,Are you okay?,
,,,,,Of course not! Look at this rotten place!,,
,,,,,This is even nastier than the scum's caves.,,
,,,,,Have you ever cleaned this place?,,
,,,,,,I... I just did!,
,,,,,You might as well find a new home. This is hopeless.,,
,,,1-1-A,II-2,That's impossible.,,
,,,,,,I- it's not that easy.,
,,,,,,I worked hard to buy this house...,
,,,,,,...and this place has plenty of memories.,
,,,,,Pfft. Like what? Memories of being poor?,,
,,,,,,!,
,,,,,"I don't care. Now that I'm here, you must tend to my needs.",,
,,,,,"First, I want you to change the bed.",,
,,,,,Don't forget to give it a ruffled bed skirt!,,
,,,,,"Chop chop, a queen cannot be laying down on junk.",,
,,,1-1-B,I-2,I might’ve missed some spots.,,
,,,,,,"T- there's no need for that, is there?",
,,,,,,I'll sweep one more time. I might’ve missed some spots.,
,,,,,Hahaha. What? You clean this place yourself?,,
,,,,,"It's YOUR place. You should just sit back, relax, and let the others do the chores.",,
,,,,,Don't you have at least one or two... what is it you call them...,,
,,,,,,Maids?,
,,,,,,I don't have the luxury of having a maid.,
,,,,,,"I'm used to taking care of things myself, too...",
,,,,,Pathetic.,,
,,I-2,,,,,
,,,,,"Ah, you're finally here. What took you so long?",,
,,,,,,... You were waiting for me?,
,,,,,You think?! Who will tidy up my room if not you?,,
,,,,,"Quick, organize the stuff in that corner first.",,
,,,,,,W- where did you get that much stuff?,
,,,,,"Pfft, as a queen, it's only natural for me to get offerings from my slaves.",,
,,,,,,Staves?,
,,,,,Those humans can't resist my beauty.,,
,,,,,"Quit slacking off, now!",,
,,,1-2-A,II-4,Where should I put these?,,
,,,,,,Those accessories... should I put them in your dresser?,
,,,,,"Ah, just throw that whole pile out.",,
,,,,,They all look so cheap and ugly. Why would they give those to me?,,
,,,,,,M- maybe it's pretty for them...,
,,,,,"Tch, what did I expect from lowly scum, anyway?",,
,,,,,,"... If they hear you talking like that, I think they might cry.",
,,,,,Don't care.,,
,,,,,They need to understand what their queen loves!,,
,,,1-2-B,II-1,Can't you do it yourself?,,
,,,,,,"You can actually do this by yourself, right?",
,,,,,Obviously. But do I want to?,,
,,,,,NO.,,
,,,,,,B- but it's not that hard! I can even show you how-,
,,,,,"Listen here, you don't let a queen waste her time with frivolities",,
,,,,,"Tch, even the Kalys are more useful...",,
,,,,,...than this one pathetic human.,,
,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,,Lamia?,
,,,,,Calling me so casually...,,
,,,,,How dare you!,,
,,,,,,W- what should I address you as?,
,,,,,Queen.,,
,,,,,,Queen...?,
,,,,,Queen Lamia.,,
,,,,,And what do you want?!,,
,,,,,,I... I probably need to bring you to Lord Willard-,
,,,,,Huh??,,
,,,,,You dare give orders to a queen?!,,
,,,1-3-A,II-1,I’m not ordering you around.,,
,,,,,,I... That's not my intention.,
,,,,,,"I just figured that, since you were newly summoned...",
,,,,,"Tch, having someone other than Master Asmodeus telling me what to do...",,
,,,,,This is an insult!,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,"Listen, human. You're nothing like him.",,
,,,,,So don't ever think of speaking to me so casually.,,
,,,,,You hear me?!,,
,,,,,,Y- yes...,
,,,1-3-B,I-2,I’m the one who summoned you.,,
,,,,,,B-but I'm the one who summoned you...,
,,,,,You may be able to summon a high-class demon like me...,,
,,,,,But that doesn't mean you can order me around!,,
,,,,,Mind your manners when talking to a queen!,,
,,,,,,I'm sorry... My queen...,
,,,,,"Good, good. Now come and do something about this room.",,
,,,,,,What's wrong with this room...?,
,,,,,Are you blind? This dull room isn't fit for royalty!,,
,,II-1,,,,,
,,,,,,Are you really the queen of the Demon Realm?,
,,,,,"Oh, doubting the queen, are we?",,
,,,,,"Not just the Demon Realm, I'm the queen of the world!",,
,,,,,,(Is she delusional or something?),
,,,,,What were you thinking just now?,,
,,,,,,"A- ah. Nothing, I swear!",
,,,,,It's just a matter of time before the Master officially make me his queen.,,
,,,2-1-A,III-1,What will you do as a queen?,,
,,,,,,Officially... that means you aren't-,
,,,,,Once I become his queen...,,
,,,,,I'll have all the succubi serve me.,,
,,,,,"That way, I won't have to move a single finger to get what I want.",,
,,,,,"Ah, what a life.",,
,,,,,,(She's... lost in thought.),
,,,2-1-B,II-2,You sound confident.,,
,,,,,,You sound confident... Did he promise to make you his queen?,
,,,,,Are those eyes only for decoration?,,
,,,,,Look at me!,,
,,,,,,O- okay...,
,,,,,"Now tell me, are there any other succubi who are as charismatic as I am?",,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,That's right. No one.,,
,,,,,No one understands the essentials of being a queen...,,
,,,,,...except me!,,
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,"C'mere, slave. It's time for my morning massage.",,
,,,,,,"Eh? Wait, I don't recall-",
,,,,,"Talking back to your queen, now?",,
,,,,,Disobedient slaves need to be punished!,,
,,,,,,"L- look, I'll gladly lend a hand if you need my help.",
,,,,,,But can't you ask nicely...?,
,,,,,That's not necessary.,,
,,,2-2-A,III-1,Do you feel grateful?,,
,,,,,,I don't understand you.,
,,,,,,Don't you feel grateful when you're helped by others?,
,,,,,Why would I? It's just how things are supposed to be.,,
,,,,,"If anything, it should be them who have to feel grateful.",,
,,,,,For they have the honor of serving the queen!,,
,,,,,,There you go again.,
,,,2-2-B,II-5,Who helped you in your realm?,,
,,,,,,I... I don't think I can keep up with you.,
,,,,,"What did I expect from a weakling like you, anyway?",,
,,,,,It'd be better if you could bring a Bastet succubus here.,,
,,,,,,Bastet?,
,,,,,They own the finest succubi to tend to me.,,
,,,,,"Plus, their servants don't talk much.",,
,,,,,,Succubi who don't talk much... Is it perhaps...?,
,,,,,You've seen a Kalys succubus?,,
,,,,,"Send them to me, then! I have no use for you!",,
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,You're already here?,,
,,,,,,Did I interrupt...?,
,,,,,Nuh-uh.,,
,,,,,A good slave must always check on their queen first thing in the morning.,,
,,,,,,"T- that's not, uh...",
,,,,,,I’ve told you I have to take care of this house myself.,
,,,,,,I also have to prepare for work...,
,,,,,,That's why I have to start early in the morning every day.,
,,,,,Sounds tiresome. Good thing I don't have to do it.,,
,,,,,Why don't you just get someone to do it for you?,,
,,,2-3-A,III-1,I can do it myself.,,
,,,,,,"Well, I can handle it myself.",
,,,,,,Unless... you're worried about me and want to help?,
,,,,,You- !,,
,,,,,Speak one more time and I'll shove that broom down your throat!,,
,,,,,,Urk...,
,,,,,"My mood is now ruined, thanks to you.",,
,,,,,"Go away, your face displeases me.",,
,,,,,,I- I understand...,
,,,2-3-B,III-3,Before all this happened...,,
,,,,,,"Before all this happened, my wife was the one who helped me...",
,,,,,,"Ah, actually, it's more like we worked together.",
,,,,,"Hmph, that's odd.",,
,,,,,,What's so odd about that?,
,,,,,"Why would you work with someone, if you could just make them work for you?",,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,,It's the time we Spent together that matters.,
,,,,,"Pfft, more like a waste of time.",,
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,,Thank you for your hard work yesterday.,
,,,,,...?,,
,,,,,,D- did I say something wrong?,
,,,,,"""Thank you?” What's that?",,
,,,,,,Uhh... It's... what you say to a person you feel grateful for.,
,,,,,,Like when they do something for you...,
,,,,,"Ugh, don't feel so full of yourself.",,
,,,,,I didn't do that for you!,,
,,,2-4-A,II-3,"What should I do, then?",,
,,,,,,I- I know...,
,,,,,,"What can I do to return the favor, then?",
,,,,,f Just serve me better.,,
,,,,,You can start with escorting me with a Victoria.,,
,,,,,,Vic- y- you know I can't afford that.,
,,,,,I don't care. I want the most elegant one.,,
,,,,,Who would let a queen sweat While she goes out on the town?,,
,,,,,,"I... I escorted you with a parasol, though.",
,,,,,And you think that's enough?!,,
,,,2-4-B,II-5,I still want to thank you.,,
,,,,,,Still... I want to thank you.,
,,,,,Why do humans bother with stuff like this?,,
,,,,,,I think it's important to let someone know that you appreciate them.,
,,,,,Appreciate...,,
,,,,,I don't understand.,,
,,,,,,"You have lots of assistants in your realm, right?",
,,,,,,What would you do if they weren't there?,
,,,,,...,,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,Ugggh... This is annoying.,,
,,,,,,Do you need help?,
,,,,,"Oh, perfect timing.",,
,,,,,Get my bangle from under the bed. I dropped it.,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,,"You could, er, you could just bend down...",
,,,,,Just do it!,,
,,,,,,"All right, all right... here you go.",
,,,,,Great. Now give it to me.,,
,,,2-5-A,III-3,"Say ""thank you"" first.",,
,,,,,,How about saying thank you first? Then I'll give it to you.,
,,,,,Quit joking. I don't have time for this.,,
,,,,,,I'm... I'm serious.,
,,,,,It's not important!,,
,,,,,,"Maybe it's not important for you, but how about for others?",
,,,,,,You can't always take everything for granted.,
,,,,,It... doesn't matter for us succubi...,,
,,,,,"Unlike you humans, we don't need petty validations!",,
,,,,,,Just... say the word...,
,,,,,I'd rather die!,,
,,,2-5-B,III-1,Here it is.,,
,,,,,,Here. Don't drop it again.,
,,,,,"If I do, I have you to get it for me, don't I?",,
,,,,,,What if I'm not around to help you?,
,,,,,I'll just wait for you to come back!,,
,,,,,,And what if I never come back?,
,,,,,I'll find other people.,,
,,,,,,You're so stubborn.,
,,,,,That's just how things are.,,
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,I don't understand...,,
,,,,,Why isn't he here yet?!,,
,,,,,,Is someone going to pick you up?,
,,,,,It's Asmodeus!,,
,,,,,Oh... I know.,,
,,,,,He must be preparing for our ceremony!,,
,,,,,That's why he's taking so long...,,
,,,,,,Is he really going to see you himself?,
,,,,,Why would he not?!,,
,,,3-1-A,III-2,Once you become the rightful queen.,,
,,,,,,"Say, once you become the rightful queen...",
,,,,,,.. what are you planning to do next?,
,,,,,Of course I would live comfortably with everyone serving me.,,
,,,,,,But don't you have to help out Asmodeus as well?,
,,,,,,Considering that you'll stand by his side...,
,,,,,Help... with what?,,
,,,,,,Taking care of the realm? Isn't that what a queen's supposed to do?,
,,,,,...,,
,,,3-1-B,EB,Her right to become the queen.,,
,,,,,,What would you do if he's not coming?,
,,,,,"Oh, believe me, he will.",,
,,,,,For I am the rightful queen.,,
,,,,,,You're rather sure about that...,
,,,,,A high-class succubus like me naturally belongs with a king.,,
,,,,,If only you weren't a peasant... I might have considered staying with you.,,
,,,,,,Eh?,
,,,,,Heehee. In your dreams!,,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,Why do you look so exhausted?,,
,,,,,,You can tell...?,
,,,,,"Well, it would be troublesome if you can't serve me.",,
,,,,,,Here I thought you were finally thinking about others.,
,,,,,,Sigh... I wish she were here...,
,,,,,Who are you talking about? Your slave?,,
,,,,,,I told you I don't need someone like that.,
,,,,,,"As husband and wife... Luna and I were more like a team, I guess.",
,,,,,,We cared about each other.,
,,,,,I still can't fathom that kind of thinking.,,
,,,3-2-A,EB,We share the same goal.,,
,,,,,,"Well, we worked hard together so we could live comfortably in this house.",
,,,,,,All the stuff that you see here... is the result of our hard work.,
,,,,,Huh? Your ancestors didn't leave an inheritance?,,
,,,,,,We can't rely on inheritance alone...,
,,,,,,"Besides, it's more meaningful when you enjoy the things you earned from hard work.",
,,,,,That doesn't apply to me.,,
,,,3-2-B,EA,Taking care of each other.,,
,,,,,,It's nice to have someone... to look after each other.,
,,,,,,"Plus, both of us worked in the same industry.",
,,,,,,So we understood each other pretty well.,
,,,,,Sounds boring.,,
,,,,,,I thought you could relate since you Seem to know Asmodeus well.,
,,,,,,Being a queen and all...,
,,,,,Urkk... How would I know about that!?,,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,,You're throwing out more stuff?,
,,,,,"If you have the time to complain, just get rid of them for me.",,
,,,,,,Are these from your fans again?,
,,,,,,You're so harsh with them...,
,,,,,I don't care.,,
,,,,,They seem to enjoy being my slaves anyway.,,
,,,3-3-A,EB,Did you give them something in return?,,
,,,,,,Did you perhaps... give them something in return?,
,,,,,Huh? I just simply exist.,,
,,,,,And they instantly swoon over me.,,
,,,,,,Ugghh...,
,,,,,It's only a matter of time until Asmodeus feels the same way.,,
,,,,,"After all, no matter how you look at me...",,
,,,,,I'm the only one for him!,,
,,,3-3-B,III-4,Make sure to thank them.,,
,,,,,,Did you thank them properly?,
,,,,,For what?,,
,,,,,It's just how things should be. Slaves must pay tribute to their queen.,,
,,,,,,Aren't you afraid that someday they will leave you?,
,,,,,,Nobody wants to be treated like this.,
,,,,,"Nope, I'll always have a slave.",,
,,,,,,W- why are you looking at me like that?,
,,,,,It's just funny...,,

,,,,,,...,
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,What's that you're holding?,,
,,,,,,Oh... It's my wife's Stuff...,
,,,,,Looks neat. Give them to me.,,
,,,,,,Uhmm... I- I can't. I'm going to keep these somewhere...,
,,,,,You don't want to listen to your queen!?,,
,,,,,,"N- no, it's just... It's the stuff from her fans...",
,,,,,,"Since she treasures them so much, I want to keep them safe for her.",
,,,,,Getting lots of gifts...,,
,,,,,Is she some kind of a queen?!,,
,,,3-4-A,EA,She's my queen.,,
,,,,,,She's my queen.,
,,,,,What's with that creepy smile?,,
,,,,,,Ah... sorry. I was just thinking about her.,
,,,,,What did she do to deserve such adoration anyway?,,
,,,,,,"Well, to start... She was a hard worker... and she valued her fans very much.",
,,,,,,"For her, it was a matter of fostering a special connection between her and her fans.",
,,,,,,I think that's why many people loved her.,
,,,,,Weird.,,
,,,3-4-B,EB,It's not like that.,,
,,,,,,It's not like that...,
,,,,,,But I think you can be more like her.,
,,,,,What do you mean?! I'm the one and only-,,
,,,,,,I- I mean... in terms of understanding your fans' feelings...,
,,,,,I don't see any benefit in doing that.,,
,,,,,,"Why don't you start with me, then?",
,,,,,Huh?,,
,,,,,,Maybe we can understand each other better.,
,,EA,,,"When she was still a succubus, Lamia's ethereal beauty captivated humans.",,

,,,,,"But now, she realizes how fulfilling it is to be rewarded for her hard work.",,
,,,,,"As if getting a second chances at his old life, Jake happily supports Lamia as her manager.",,
,,EB,,,"When she turned into a human, Jake believed it meant that Lamia had fallen in love with him.",,

,,,,,A safe word?,,
,,,,,,"... Let's not talk about it, shall we?",
,,,1-3-B,II-2,Are those made specially for you?,,
,,,,,,Were they made specifically for you?,

,,,,,Ahahaha. I know what you're thinking!,,
,,,,,My bloodlust can't be stopped.,,
,,,,,It's your fault for ordering me not to kill any humans.,,
,,,2-1-A,II-2,You even kill other succubi?,,
,,,,,,Do you... kill your own kind?,

,,,,,They think they deserve to be the Master's right hand.,,
,,,,,But then he chose us instead! Ahahahaha!,,
,,,,,,Is it because you're stronger?,
,,,,,Of course! Our ability to kill is second to none!,,
,,,2-2-A,III-1,You'd do anything for the Master?,,

,,,,,,"So, your kind aren't liked by the others?",
,,,,,Hmph.,,
,,,,,It's because all they care about is collecting Carnal Essence!,,
,,,,,We are more than that!,,

,,,,,Ugh.,,
,,,,,,Don't tell me you're thinking of killing-,
,,,,,Shut up!,,
,,,,,I won’t let myself end up like those rebel scum...,,
,,II-3,,,,,

,,,2-3-A,II-4,That's insane!,,
,,,,,,Killing other demons? That's insane!,
,,,,,What's insane is the competition!,,
,,,,,It's really tight. The kill count leader changes every other day.,,

,,,,,Then we die.,,
,,,,,It would just mean we weren't strong enough to live.,,

,,,,,Leave at once!,,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,,The most powerful succubus...,

,,,,,,"Oh, sorry... I was just thinking...",

,,,,,"In a fair fight, no.",,
,,,,,,Wait. Does that mean there's a succubus even stronger than the Enyo?,
,,,,,But it's not a fair fight!,,
,,,2-5-A,III-1,Who could be stronger than your kind?,,
,,,,,She was drunk! It doesn't count!,,

,,,,,One of my kind was knocked out by a drunken Nocti.,,
,,,,,If only we already had this tail and arms...,,

,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,,Now that everyone respects your kind...,
,,,,,,Do you feel grateful to the Master?,
,,,,,"Pfft, I actually don't care.",,
,,,,,It just feels good to be a living weapon.,,
,,,,,,And have the respect of the other succubi?,
,,,,,"Yeah, yeah, that too-",,
,,,,,Uhh... not that I care about their respect. Don't get the wrong idea!,,
,,,3-1-A,III-2,The Master has helped your kind a lot.,,

,,,,,,I... I don’t... I'm not...,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,,"Enyo, do you want to go somewhere you can relax?",
,,,,,Relax?,,
,,,,,,Yes... Somewhere to lie down and do nothing.,
,,,,,What's the occasion?,,
,,,,,,Maybe it'll help you to not think so much.,
,,,,,,About... you know...,

,,,,,Just say the word!,,
,,,,,,"N- no, not that.",
,,,,,,"Is it only me, or do the others seem not too familiar with you?",
,,,,,You think so?,,
,,,,,They are just jealous that Master Asmodeus took a liking to our kind.,,
,,,,,"The previous ruler, Agrath, didn't even know that we existed.",,

,,,,,,"I believe you are free to be whatever you want to be, Enyo.",

,,III-4,,,,,

,,,3-4-A,EA,Other succubi...,,

,,,,,,"They have their own goals, and they work hard to achieve them.",
,,,,,You mean I need to have a goal?,,
,,,,,,"Yeah, then you'll be able to See that there's more to life than just killing.",
,,,,,How annoying.,,

,,,,,And how do you propose you do that?,,
,,,,,,By accompanying you as you try out different things in this realm!,

,,,,,Grrrrr...,,
,,,,,"I'll rip that arrogant face off your body someday, Jake. Just you wait.",,
,,,,,,(Uh oh.),
,,EA,,,"What is more fulfilling than killing? For Enyo who is no longer a demon, that became her new life's question.",,
,,,,,Living without mighty arms nor a deadly tail was certainly a new experience for her.,,
,,,,,"When she accepted Jake and transformed, however, a twinge in her chest told her that this new question was a good one to have.",,
,,,,,The days she spends with Jake are filled with laughter.,,
,,EB,,,Wanting to tame Enyo was the worst decision Jake could have ever made.,,

,,,1-1-A,I-2,Who was she talking to?,,
,,,,,,"S- so, uh, who were you talking to?",
,,,,,,How important was that conversation?,
,,,,,Important enough that no human should have meddled with it.,,
,,,,,I was this close. I spent so long building the courage to say something and...,,
,,,,,... And shame on you. You just ruined the whole thing.,,
,,,,,,"O- oh, I see... My apologies.",
,,,,,What do you want me to do here?!,,
,,,,,I'll get it done so I can go back as soon as possible.,,
,,,,,,Right. I'll do my best to help you. I think?,
,,,1-1-B,II-2,Was it with your ruler?,,
,,,,,,So... were you with the leader of the succubi?,
,,,,,Asmodeus? As if. That demon could never compare to the rightful ruler!,,
,,,,,,But you were talking about the ruler of the Demon Realm...,
,,,,,Did I say it had to be Asmodeus? I did not.,,
,,,,,,Does that mean...,
,,,,,Indeed! There is someone much better suited to the throne than him.,,
,,,,,,But isn't he the previous ruler's son? Doesn't that make him the rightful king?,

,,,,,Good.,,
,,,,,Now... what's your business here?,,
,,,1-2-A,II-2,About Asmodeus...,,

,,,,,,"I mean, the other succubi fear him as the strongest in your realm...",

,,,,,"If I have to hear about that living fart, it better be bad news.",,

,,,,,Get out.,,
,,,1-2-B,II-1,About the other demon...,,
,,,,,,Who was that person you were talking about before?,
,,,,,Huh?,,
,,,,,,The one you need to get back to as soon as possible?,
,,,,,Ah! Her!,,
,,,,,,I just kinda figured that knowing more about her would help me get to know you.,

,,,,,Yes?,,
,,,1-3-A,II-2,Was it your ruler?,,
,,,,,,"This could probably me being dumb, but uhh...",
,,,,,,"The person you were talking about, was it the Demon King?",
,,,,,What? Such idiocy!,,
,,,,,Why would I waste my time thinking about something So stupid!,,
,,,,,The Achlys have far grander things to worry about than some tyrant!,,
,,,,,,O- oh....,
,,,,,,(She doesn't seem to be fond of the Demon King.),
,,,,,Are you spacing out? Snap out of it!,,
,,,,,,"W- wait, I mean, no I'm not! I just wanted to ask that.",

,,,1-3-B,I-2,Someone you cared about?,,

,,,,,Hmph. Maybe you're not a hopeless case after all.,,
,,,,,,Is there anything I could do to make amends?,

,,,,,,Nimue?,
,,,,,Yes. The succubus I admire is a Nimue.,,
,,,,,"Hmm. You're a moron, but you don't seem to be a bad person. I guess I can tell you more.",,
,,,,,,So that's their name...,
,,,,,,"But then, what made the Nimue earn your devotion?",
,,,,,The Nimue are like no one else!,,
,,,,,"They have everything we lack! The will, the good qualities...",,
,,,2-1-A,II-4,Their good qualities?,,
,,,,,,What kind of qualities do you mean?,
,,,,,"Well, as you can see from me...",,
,,,,,The Achlys are quite the brooders.,,

,,,,,,(She's totally devoted.),
,,,2-1-B,II-3,Your life with them.,,
,,,,,,"So, how was your life with them?",
,,,,,The epitome of balance.,,
,,,,,It gave me peace of mind that nobody else ever gave.,,
,,,,,"Unfortunately, other succubi had to exist and ruin it all.",,
,,,,,,So someone else got involved?,
,,,,,Someone else took the Nimue's attention.,,
,,,,,Things started going bad ever since they came into the picture.,,
,,,,,Then the rebellion happened and the Nimue strayed even further from our kind.,,
,,,,,And...,,
,,,,,,(Maybe I shouldn't have brought that up.),
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,,"You really hate the Demon King, don't you?",
,,,,,"It's written all over my face, isn't it?",,
,,,,,There is no merit in serving him. Not even in just living under him.,,
,,,,,,How so?,
,,,,,Life has been worse ever since he took the throne.,,
,,,,,Not to mention that the Nimue fought to free us.,,
,,,,,,"Um, I can't see how that was bad for you.",
,,,,,"Because of that, we Spent even less time with the Nimue! They had a rebellion to carry out!",,
,,,2-2-A,II-3,You worked with them?,,
,,,,,,"So, you assisted the Nimue during the rebellion?",
,,,,,I would never refuse anything they asked of me.,,
,,,,,"Rather, I believe that only our kind are able to fulfill their expectations.",,
,,,,,So I volunteered.,,
,,,,,,"Then, the Nimue were the leaders of the rebellion?",
,,,,,Not so. I wish they were. We might have won that way.,,
,,,,,"I could care less about the actual leader, but the Nimue's valor was something to behold.",,
,,,,,,So they were the main force the rebellion...,
,,,,,And we lost.,,
,,,,,,Oh... I see.,
,,,2-2-B,III-3,You can't live without them.,,
,,,,,,"You can't live without them, can you?",
,,,,,"We cannot. The lives of the Achlys are the Nimue's, and theirs alone.",,
,,,,,,"So, your devotion...",
,,,,,It is more real than anything I have ever believed in my pitiful life.,,
,,,,,"You are correct, human. I cannot live without them.",,
,,,,,,I see...,
,,,,,Which is why your summoning made me so angry. That could have been my last chance to talk to them...,,
,,,,,,"Um, sorry.",
,,,,,Apology accepted. Now let's get back to Work.,,
,,,,,,Sure.,
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,,Am I interrupting?,
,,,,,I am in the middle of tying my hair. It's trivial.,,
,,,,,,(She's tying her hair differently than usual.),
,,,,,,(I've never seen her style her hair before. This is refreshing.),
,,,,,What is it? You have a funny look on your face.,,
,,,,,,"Oh! No, I was just thinking to myself. Sorry.",
,,,,,No matter. You can wait right there until I am done.,,
,,,,,,Th- thank you.,
,,,,,,"(It feels like I am at her mercy, even though she said it's fine.)",
,,,,,Why do they look at Yrellea more than us?,,
,,,2-3-A,II-5,Yrellea?,,
,,,,,,(She's still looking for the best way to tie her hair.),
,,,,,,"Um, who is Yrellea?",
,,,,,The instigator of the rebellion.,,
,,,,,The one who actually lead the resistance.,,
,,,,,The one who took the Nimue's attention from me.,,
,,,,,,"So, is this Yrellea's hairstyle that you're trying to put on?",
,,,,,,(I do NOT like that death glare!),
,,,,,,I was just kidding! Sorry!,
,,,,,Make that joke again and you won't live to See morning.,,
,,,,,,I- I won’t!,
,,,2-3-B,III-1,Is this about the Nimue?,,
,,,,,,"So, is this to impress the Nimue kind?",
,,,,,"Ah, wouldn't that be nice?",,
,,,,,If only I didn't have to meet you.,,
,,,,,,(She's nursing that grudge.),
,,,,,"Then again, it's too late for me.",,
,,,,,,Why would you say that?,
,,,,,"The last time I spoke to a Nimue, they were completely focused on the rebellion.",,
,,,,,,On continuing it?,
,,,,,Yes. And especially on finding Yrellea. It was an uphill battle to make her look at me.,,
,,,,,,(It's almost funny how the actual rebellion means almost nothing to her.),
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,How dare he!,,
,,,,,,What happened?,
,,,,,The gall of him to talk that way even if he was the one who wanted it!,,
,,,,,,I'm... still lost.,
,,,,,There was a patron who wanted to do it with my true form.,,
,,,,,And then he couldn't stop complaining about my wing!,,
,,,,,,So...,
,,,,,Do I really have to explain to you why I would hate every second of that?,,
,,,2-4-A,III-2,Want to take a break?,,
,,,,,,"If you want to, I can reassign you somewhere else today.",
,,,,,No. It's all right.,,
,,,,,,(Her face says otherwise.),
,,,,,"I mean, it's just another day at work, right?",,
,,,,,I could just give him a a taste of this wing he dislikes so much.,,
,,,,,,Um...,
,,,,,*sigh* Maybe I was in the wrong to just do what he wanted.,,
,,,,,I have to be better about talking to clients.,,
,,,,,I’ll just refuse his wishes next time!,,
,,,,,,"Well, as long as you know what to do, I guess.",
,,,2-4-B,II-5,Don't listen to him.,,
,,,,,,Couldn't you just ignore him and move on?,
,,,,,"Well, it's already happened. What are you talking about?",,
,,,,,,"Um, don't take it to heart then? I- I mean don't let it get to you.",
,,,,,,Everyone has something about them that's beautiful.,
,,,,,"Well, except me, I guess.",,
,,,,,There is nothing about me that could be called beautiful.,,
,,,,,,I- I don’t think that's true...,
,,,,,It is. Why else would they look at Yrellea instead of me?,,
,,,,,,It's...,
,,,,,Leave me alone. I need time to breathe.,,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,What are you holding there?,,
,,,,,,"Oh, this?",
,,,,,,It's a deer skull to decorate the other room we have.,
,,,,,I've never seen a deer preserved after death like this.,,
,,,,,I can see that it does indeed have a good pair of horns.,,
,,,,,,They're called antlers. Do you want to have them? It's fine by me.,
,,,,,"No need, I am more comfortable with mine.",,
,,,,,,(Now that she mentions it...),
,,,,,,(Those bony masks look peculiar...),
,,,2-5-A,III-3,Where did you get that mask?,,
,,,,,,I've been curious about this for a while...,
,,,,,Yes?,,
,,,,,,Where did that mask come from?,
,,,,,,It doesn't look like an ordinary bone mask.,
,,,,,"Hah! Finally, you show some taste.",,
,,,,,,"So, it's not from this realm.",
,,,,,Obviously. I could only salvage a mask like this from a demon's carcass.,,
,,,,,,That's... unexpectedly brutal.,
,,,,,"I did warn you about us Achlys, haven't I?",,
,,,,,,I just never assumed you were capable of doing this.,
,,,2-5-B,III-1,Do you like horns?,,
,,,,,,"So, it's because you like horns?",
,,,,,Yes. I adore them!,,
,,,,,,Does it have to do with the Nimue?,
,,,,,Nope! I've always loved horns.,,
,,,,,"This mask felt perfect for me, so I kept it.",,
,,,,,Maybe because I don't have horns of my own?,,
,,,,,"Whatever it is, it fascinates me.",,
,,,,,,I didn't realize not all of you succubi had horns.,
,,,,,Were all quite different physiologically!,,
,,,,,,I see.,
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,Jake.,,
,,,,,,Yes?,
,,,,,You seemed to be good at managing us.,,
,,,,,It's like you're no stranger to this.,,
,,,,,,I WAS a manager for a singer before this.,
,,,,,"You sound like Yrellea, actually...",,
,,,,,Being so good at handling people... Being so decisive...,,
,,,3-1-A,EB,Maybe that's why the Nimue followed Yrellea.,,
,,,,,,"I see, then.",
,,,,,,Perhaps that's why the Nimue followed her.,
,,,,,Now that you put it that way...,,
,,,,,I guess I can see how it is.,,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,"There goes me ever accepting myself for who I am, I guess.",,
,,,,,I never even stood a chance.,,
,,,,,,Don’t feel so bad... We can look up Yrellea later.,
,,,,,"You really don’t understand, do you?",,
,,,3-1-B,III-2,You have your own strong points as well.,,
,,,,,,While you probably think Yrellea is the pinnacle of the succubi...,
,,,,,,I believe you are your own great self.,
,,,,,Yrellea's indeed strong and irresistible. No wonder even the Nimue follow her.,,
,,,,,,Don’t think so little of yourself!,
,,,,,,Your diligence and devotion are wonderful traits to have.,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,"Thank you, Jake. That feels... nice.",,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,,Hey.,
,,,,,,I've been hearing nothing but good news from our patrons.,
,,,,,What kind?,,
,,,,,,Madam M and Mistress X sung their praises about you for the attention you paid their lessons.,
,,,,,"... Oh, they did?",,
,,,3-2-A,EA,Be proud of yourself!,,
,,,,,,You should be proud of yourself.,
,,,,,,It's fine to reward yourself for everything you've gone through.,
,,,,,Even hardships?,,
,,,,,,Especially hardships.,
,,,,,,You've been living apart from the Nimue for some time now.,
,,,,,,Be proud.,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,"Thank you, Jake.",,
,,,3-2-B,III-4,There are things you don’t realize.,,
,,,,,,You see.,
,,,,,,There are things you don’t realize on your own.,
,,,,,What are you talking about? I know myself!,,
,,,,,I've been getting by doing what you've told me to. I'm nothing special.,,
,,,,,,But that's the thing. You managed to do everything I asked you to.,
,,,,,It was not perfect.,,
,,,,,,But it was better than everyone else.,
,,,,,,"Maybe, just maybe, people actually look at you different than how you imagined.",
,,,,,,"Because from what I see, you are getting better at just about everything.",
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,"Jake, I'm going to do it. I'm going to be the best succubus I can be.",,
,,,,,,"That's great! But uh, why the sudden motivation?",
,,,,,I need the Nimue to recognize me. I need them...,,
,,,,,,Oh.,
,,,,,"And what's more, I've learned a lot from Madam M.",,
,,,,,,Learned about what?,
,,,,,Whatever I need to look good in the eyes of the Nimue.,,
,,,3-3-A,III-4,Wrong motivation.,,
,,,,,,I... think you have a slightly skewed motivation to be better.,
,,,,,How so?,,
,,,,,,You can’t live your life searching for others' approval.,
,,,,,,What would you do for yourself?,
,,,,,But... but I need them to look at me...,,
,,,,,,How? Do you think the Nimue would be so amazing if they could be impressed by an act?,
,,,,,By...,,
,,,,,Um...,,
,,,,,,"You still have to be you, don’t you?",
,,,,,... This is true.,,
,,,,,,Then you can see my point.,
,,,,,,(I hope she thinks more about this.),
,,,3-3-B,EA,Good for you!,,
,,,,,,Nice to see you look motivated.,
,,,,,But of course. Anything for the Nimue.,,
,,,,,,Hey.,
,,,,,What is it?,,
,,,,,,You can call me if there is anything you need.,
,,,,,,I'll be sure to support you as much as I possibly can.,
,,,,,... Yeah. Thanks.,,
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,That lady...,,
,,,,,,You mean Luna?,
,,,,,I've seen her portraits all over this house.,,
,,,,,And I've been meaning to ask you this.,,
,,,,,,Yes?,
,,,,,What is she to you? Do you love her?,,
,,,,,,"She was my wife, and I loved her. I still do.",
,,,,,Was she a perfect lady worthy of your love?,,
,,,3-4-A,EB,The utmost perfect lady.,,
,,,,,,She was perfect to me.,
,,,,,How did she do that?,,
,,,,,,"Well... humans can never be truly perfect, but you can be perfect in someone's eyes.",
,,,,,,"She loved me for all I was, and I loved her back even more. She's the whole reason I'm doing this.",
,,,,,,"I... I cannot live without her. I am a broken clock, an empty shell. I don’t know what to do with myself.",
,,,,,"So, you and I are alike, huh?",,
,,,3-4-B,EA,I loved her for who she was.,,
,,,,,,To be human is to have all these imperfections.,
,,,,,,Even for someone I adored as much as her.,
,,,,,,"She had her own flaws, but one of her strengths was enduring them with such tenacity.",
,,,,,,She motivated me with how she would overcome her own weaknesses. it was her own kind of magic.,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,"Sometimes, the most beautiful things are imperfect.",
,,,,,You sure loved her.,,
,,,,,,It is the only thing I truly know to be real.,
,,,,,Hehehe. Hahahaha. You and I both.,,
,,EA,,,There is no such thing as perfection. That is what Jake always said to Achlys.,,
,,,,,"As Jake's words seep into her, she starts to feel more comfortable with herself.",,
,,,,,"No more hiding under her mask, she's already a perfect woman to Jake.",,
,,EB,,,Jake always assures Achlys that there is nothing wrong with her.,,
,,,,,"To prove his words, he turned Achlys into a human. However, it did nothing to help her.",,
,,,,,She has become more self-conscious than ever now that she's become a human.,,
,,,,,She feels that she's even more worthless without her power as a succubus.,,
11,Cozbi,I-1,,,Cozbi,,
,,,,,Keh heh heh. What a nice house you have here.,,
,,,,,And it's still empty... perfect.,,
,,,,,,Huh? I'm not even sure if I can add more furniture...,
,,,,,"Meh, not that dull stuff.",,
,,,,,Your house lacks shine!,,
,,,,,,But I cleaned it-,
,,,,,Nooo... rrrggh... it lacks sparkly stuff!,,
,,,,,,Sparkly... You mean like gold-coated items or something?,
,,,,,That's the stuff!,,
,,,1-1-A,I-2,You like luxurious goods?,,
,,,,,,"Could it be... perhaps, you like luxurious goods?",
,,,,,Like? Heh heh!,,
,,,,,We're OBSESSED.,,
,,,,,Take a good look at what I'm wearing.,,
,,,,,"You must be jealous that you don’t have anything like these babies, right?",,
,,,,,,"Uhmm, they are neat, I guess?",
,,,,,What's with that reaction? So boring!,,
,,,1-1-B,II-2,I don’t think it's necessary.,,
,,,,,,I don’t think it's necessary for me to add that kind of stuff to my house...,
,,,,,,"Moreover, something doesn’t have to be sparkly to have value, right?",
,,,,,Booorrrrring!,,
,,,,,"In that case, I'll just use this house to store my stash.",,
,,,,,,You want to do what now?,
,,,,,Are you deaf? I need a place to keep my new collection before I go back.,,
,,,,,,W- wait a minute-,
,,,,,I don’t take no for an answer!,,
,,I-2,,,,,
,,,,,"Hey, hey, look, ain’t these neat?",,
,,,,,,Huh? Are those accessories new?,
,,,,,Yup!,,
,,,,,,Where did you get those from?,
,,,,,"From the humans, of course.",,
,,,,,,"Wait, did you... steal them?",
,,,,,"Pssch, it's give and take, y'know?",,
,,,,,"I give them pleasure, they give me their stuff.",,
,,,1-2-A,II-1,About your kind.,,
,,,,,,Are all of your kind like that?,
,,,,,More or less.,,
,,,,,We find beauty in sparkly stuff.,,
,,,,,,That's good... but please don’t steal.,
,,,,,It's their fault for being so careless.,,
,,,,,"If something is important to them, then they should take better care of it.",,
,,,,,,B- but...,
,,,,,"Hush, now.",,
,,,1-2-B,II-3,Why is it so important?,,
,,,,,,Why are you so obsessed with shiny objects?,
,,,,,,"I mean, does it really matter?",
,,,,,,What do you get from collecting them?,
,,,,,My head hurts. You ask too many questions.,,
,,,,,"Feel it with your heart, fool.",,
,,,,,"The more you have, the more fulfilled you are.",,
,,,,,,(Talk about being greedy...),
,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,"Oy, what are you up to? Barging into my room like that.",,
,,,,,,"Ah, sorry, I'm looking for my stuff...",
,,,,,What stuff?,,
,,,,,,My house decorations...,
,,,,,... Why are you looking at me like that?,,
,,,,,,"N- no, it's just... my stuff keeps disappearing.",
,,,1-3-A,II-4,Did you take it?,,
,,,,,,Umm... did you take it?,
,,,,,"Hmm, did I snatch it in front of your eyes?",,
,,,,,,N- no...,
,,,,,,But... What are those on top of your dresser?,
,,,,,Just some stuff that's lying around.,,
,,,,,,Th- Those are mine.,
,,,,,"Nope, mine now.",,
,,,,,"They just lie around in every corner of the house, so I took them.",,
,,,,,"If you don’t want your stuff to get taken away, then take better care of it!",,
,,,,,,But... that's not how...,
,,,1-3-B,I-2,Have you seen it?,,
,,,,,,Have you seen my decorations?,
,,,,,Like hell I know.,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,Can you stop snooping around my room?,,
,,,,,,I... I just want to check.,
,,,,,"If you don’t want your stuff to get taken, then keep it somewhere safe!",,
,,,,,,B- but it's in my house.,
,,,,,What a fool.,,
,,II-1,,,,,
,,,,,,Cozbi?,
,,,,,,Don’t you think that this room is getting kinda cramped?,
,,,,,"Eh, I think it's all right. There's still so much room.",,
,,,,,,Seriously?,
,,,,,,I can barely open the door...,
,,,,,Uggh... Quit nagging.,,
,,,,,This is nothing compared to my place.,,
,,,2-1-A,II-2,What's your place like?,,
,,,,,,It makes me wonder what your place is like.,
,,,,,"Quite spacious, I must say.",,
,,,,,"But of course, no corner is without my beautiful collections.",,
,,,,,,Is it like... a cave or something?,
,,,,,The shiniest cave!,,
,,,,,,I can imagine it...,
,,,2-1-B,II-3,Clean up?,,
,,,,,,Don’t you want to try cleaning up?,
,,,,,Cleaning up?,,
,,,,,,Like... sorting your stuff...,
,,,,,,Keeping the ones that you use and getting rid of the others.,
,,,,,... Are you kidding me?,,
,,,,,Each and every one of my sparkly babies are precious!,,
,,,,,And you want ME to get rid of it?!,,
,,,,,,It... it's for your own good.,
,,,,,Nothing good will come of it!,,
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,,I still don’t understand...,
,,,,,,What makes you so obsessed with sparkly stuff?,
,,,,,"Like I said, their beauty is incomparable.",,
,,,,,"Besides, I feel fulfilled if I get to have it all.",,
,,,,,And it's kinda interesting Seeing others fight over my possessions.,,
,,,,,"But of course, I won’t let them take it!",,
,,,,,,The others... Do you mean the other kinds of succubi?,
,,,,,Our rivalry does not concern them.,,
,,,,,,It's just among your kind then?,
,,,,,It's a race to collect the most luxurious stuff!,,
,,,2-2-A,III-3,Symbol of wealth?,,
,,,,,,Does it mean that the collections are like...,
,,,,,,Some kind of symbol of wealth?,
,,,,,"Hmmm, yes, you could say that.",,
,,,,,Anything else you want to ask?,,
,,,,,,"Ah, did I ask too many questions?",
,,,,,,Sorry if I'm being rude-,
,,,,,"Heh, you worry too much about trivial things.",,
,,,,,I could brag about my collections all day!,,
,,,2-2-B,II-3,Do you have to follow it?,,
,,,,,,"But... Do you have to follow it, though?",
,,,,,Huh?,,
,,,,,,What I'm trying to say is...,
,,,,,,Can you choose not to follow that tradition?,
,,,,,"... Ugh, what the hell?",,
,,,,,I'm just doing what I like. Why are you so bothered by that?,,
,,,,,,"O- oh, I didn’t mean to pry.",
,,,,,,I'll... I'll stop now.,
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,"Y'know, for someone who always nags me about having too much Stuff...",,
,,,,,Have you taken a look at your own room?,,
,,,,,,It's still much more spacious than this room...,
,,,,,"But there is stuff you don’t use, right?",,
,,,,,"For example, the jewelry...",,
,,,,,Just give it to me. I'll take good care of your things.,,
,,,,,,I- I can’t give them to you.,
,,,2-3-A,III-1,Special place in heart.,,
,,,,,,Those jewels are my wife's...,
,,,,,,They hold a special place in my heart.,
,,,,,So sappy...,,
,,,,,"Even the clothes? Those are really dull, though.",,
,,,,,,I... don’t have the heart to throw them away.,
,,,,,You're weird.,,
,,,2-3-B,III-3,Belongs to my wife.,,
,,,,,,Because it belongs to my wife.,
,,,,,I see... I understand.,,
,,,,,She does have good taste in jewelry.,,
,,,,,,Eh? That's not-,
,,,,,"See, you're actually not that different from me.",,
,,,,,You can’t let them go because their beauty captivates you!,,
,,,,,,Y- you've got it wrong...,
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,"Hey, can’t you just send me home now?",,
,,,,,,"Ah, are you feeling tired?",
,,,,,,"I'm... I'm not sure how, but maybe Phillip knows how to-",
,,,,,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.",,
,,,,,You don’t know how to send me home?,,
,,,,,How am I gonna make sure that my collections are safe?,,
,,,,,,"B- but they're in your home, right?",
,,,,,"Yeah, duh, you think the others will just sit quietly seeing an unguarded cave?",,
,,,2-4-A,II-5,Cautious even with your Kind?,,
,,,,,,Are you this cautious even with your own kind?,
,,,,,Well...,,
,,,,,"I've told you before, if we're careless, even just a little bit...",,
,,,,,What's ours can become someone else's in a few seconds.,,
,,,,,That's why I have to go to the extra mile.,,
,,,,,,Sounds tiring...,
,,,,,Not really.,,
,,,2-4-B,II-3,Don’t you get tired?,,
,,,,,,"Don’t you get tired, living anxiously like that?",
,,,,,Huh? Anxious? Nope.,,
,,,,,"If something gets stolen, then I'll just collect more stuff.",,
,,,,,Easy.,,
,,,,,"Though, it would actually be tiring if I have to start from nothing again.",,
,,,,,,So... It's about quantity?,
,,,,,What's important is to have LOTS of sparkles!,,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,56... 57... 58...,,
,,,,,,What are you doing?,
,,,,,Just counting my stuff.,,
,,,,,"... Wait, where was I?",,
,,,,,,"Hey, I'm curious... when did all this get started?",
,,,,,,"I mean, this competition thing with your kind.",
,,,,,How should I know?,,
,,,,,"Living in a slum, all we know is collecting things.",,
,,,,,,Slum?,
,,,,,Others might get to live next to the throne...,,
,,,,,But we live deep in caves.,,
,,,,,"It's boring, y'know, just tryna survive in a gloomy place like that.",,
,,,,,That's why we fill it with shiny goods!,,
,,,2-5-A,III-3,I can sympathize.,,
,,,,,,Oh... so that's why.,
,,,,,"Pfft, what would you know?",,
,,,,,,"Well, I can only imagine.",
,,,,,,"But, that's right, you're the one who really know how it feels.",
,,,,,... What's with this mushy atmosphere?,,
,,,,,,"Oh, s- sorry.",
,,,,,"Ugh... Leave me alone with my babies, would you?",,
,,,,,,Okay...,
,,,2-5-B,III-1,Makes your life worse.,,
,,,,,,But... wouldn’t stuffing it just make it worse?,
,,,,,Whaddya mean?,,
,,,,,,It keeps piling up! at this rate you could get crushed by your own collection!,
,,,,,,So maybe... you can try to organize first?,
,,,,,,Starting with this room...,
,,,,,,"That way, your home can be a better place to live in.",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,A- are you listening?,
,,,,,Nope. I got bored.,,
,,,,,,...,
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,I think this should go here...,,
,,,,,,Hmm? You've started tidying up?,
,,,,,That's not it.,,
,,,,,I just don’t want them to scratch each other.,,
,,,,,,"Then, while you're at it, why don’t you try decluttering?",
,,,,,Decluttering?,,
,,,,,,"Yes, that way you can have more space in your room.",
,,,,,"Whoa, who said that I want to throw them away?",,
,,,3-1-A,III-2,I can help you tidy up.,,
,,,,,,"I got too excited, sorry.",
,,,,,I don’t get how it could make you excited.,,
,,,,,,But if you need some help to tidy up...,
,,,,,,... I can always lend a hand.,
,,,,,Don’t bother...,,
,,,3-1-B,EB,You can keep them.,,
,,,,,,"O- oh, never mind, then...",
,,,,,,As long as you don’t bury the house.,
,,,,,I can’t guarantee that.,,
,,,,,Have you checked in your room?,,
,,,,,,W- what did you do to my room??,
,,,,,"Keh heh. Don’t be so surprised, my Jake.",,
,,,,,"After all, what's yours is mine.",,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,"I know it's your house, but...",,
,,,,,Don’t you think you've been doing this too much?,,
,,,,,,What do you mean?,
,,,,,"Going into my room, what else?",,
,,,,,You worried that I might blow up your house?,,
,,,,,,Kind of...,
,,,,,,How about this:,
,,,3-2-A,EA,I will let go of Luna's possessions.,,
,,,,,,If you at least try to sort your stuff up...,
,,,,,,... I'll even let go of my wife's possessions.,
,,,,,You're using me as your excuse to tidy up?,,
,,,,,,T- that's not it.,
,,,,,,I'm concerned about the way you live.,
,,,,,"Tch, what a worrywart...",,
,,,3-2-B,EB,See how you can keep up.,,
,,,,,,You can continue collecting stuff...,
,,,,,,... and let's see how you can keep up Storing all that.,
,,,,,"Oh, you finally accepted the way I live?",,
,,,,,Or is that a challenge?,,
,,,,,Cause I'll gladly accept it.,,
,,,,,,T- that's not-,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,Got any stuff for me?,,
,,,,,,Eh?,
,,,,,Maybe I should make a rule.,,
,,,,,Every time you enter my room...,,
,,,,,you need to give me at least one offering.,,
,,,,,,W- why?,
,,,,,Why not?,,
,,,3-3-A,III-4,I don’t want to.,,
,,,,,,I- I don’t want to enable your behavior.,
,,,,,I don’t see anything wrong with my behavior.,,
,,,,,It brings no harm!,,
,,,,,Except...,,
,,,,,Your nagging gives me headaches.,,
,,,3-3-B,EA,"Not gold, but...",,
,,,,,,"If it makes you happy, I guess I can give you this.",
,,,,,What's this?,,
,,,,,,Yellow topaz. I got it from the market.,
,,,,,,The color reminds me of your eyes.,
,,,,,"Hub, it doesn’t shine like gold, but it's... pretty.",,
,,,,,"This isn’t a bad choice of gift, I'll give you that.",,
,,,,,,"Sometimes, something simple can be more meaningful.",
,,,,,"Pfft, there you are, being all sappy again.",,
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,,Have you ever heard a story...,
,,,,,,"... about someone so greedy, his treasure ended up crushing him?",
,,,,,Your point is?,,
,,,,,,"If you keep piling your stuff up, you could end up like him.",
,,,,,"Meh, it doesn’t apply to me.",,
,,,,,I've lived like this all my life.,,
,,,,,And I'm perfectly fine. See?,,
,,,,,,"I don’t think you can store any more stuff in this room, though.",
,,,,,"Well, you've got a point...",,
,,,,,Why don’t you help me with that?,,
,,,3-4-A,III-2,I’ll help you organize.,,
,,,,,,You want my help?,
,,,,,,"Let's get started, then.",
,,,,,"Wait, wait, what are you doing?",,
,,,,,,I'm... helping you sort your stuff out?,
,,,,,,"Here, are you still using this one? If not, we can throw it away.",
,,,,,D- don’t touch it!,,
,,,,,"Ugh, this is not what I meant.",,
,,,,,Just... Go away.,,
,,,3-4-B,EB,You can use another room.,,
,,,,,,Hmmm...,
,,,,,,There's actually an unused space...,
,,,,,Perfect! Why didn’t you tell me sooner?,,
,,,,,"Help me carry these there, but be careful!",,
,,,,,,"W- wait, listen to me first.",
,,,,,Ain’t nobody got time for that!,,
,,,,,,Sigh...,
,,EA,,,"Leaving behind her possessions in her realm, Cozbi slowly lets go of the ones she collected in the Human Realm as well.",,
,,,,,"She realizes that it has to be done, so she truly starts a new life as a human.",,
,,,,,Jake continues to support her by helping her tidy up.,,
,,,,,"After all, they will spend the rest of their lives together.",,
,,EB,,,Cozbi's obsession towards her collection can no longer be helped.,,
,,,,,"In the name of love, Jake lets her do what she wants.",,
,,,,,"The more he turns a blind eye to the problem, however, the more the house is flooded by Cozbi's greed.",,
,,,,,"Until one day, they are both crushed under the weight of the hoard.",,

,,,,,"Heehee, a male human...",,
,,,,,It's been an eternity since I last devoured one...,,
,,,,,"Since Master Asmodeus isn't here, I think you will do.",,
,,,,,,D- devour?,
,,,,,,Oh... Did you mean...,
,,,,,,You want my Carnal Essence?,
,,,,,"Dear, dear... I only want to bask in pleasure.",,

,,,1-1-A,I-2,Don't generalize us.,,

,,,,,...,,
,,,,,Huuuh? Why noooot?,,
,,,,,You're one weird human. But I like you.,,
,,,1-1-B,II-3,That's not why I summoned you.,,
,,,,,,Urk... B- but that's not why I summoned you...,

,,,,,,...,
,,,,,,"F- forget about that, I shouldn't ask...",

,,,,,,But I'll die if you do that.,
,,,,,Die of pleasure? Who wouldn't want that?,,
,,,,,,You'll suck my Carnal Essence dry!,
,,,,,Ahh... Yes... If only men didn't die just when I start really having fun.,,
,,,,,But the sensation of their Carnal Essence seeping inside me...,,
,,,,,It's the best!,,
,,,1-2-A,II-1,Does it make you stronger?,,
,,,,,,Do you... feel stronger after that?,
,,,,,Mmhmm... I feel like I can do it again and again. Hehehe... And again...,,
,,,,,,O- okay...,
,,,,,,"That's the power of Carnal Essence for you, I guess...",
,,,,,,"Do you think it applies to humans, too?",
,,,,,Hmm? Where do you think your libido comes from?,,
,,,,,It's such a fantastic source of energy!,,
,,,1-2-B,II-3,Does it only apply to human men?,,
,,,,,,Does that mean... Carnal Essence can only be found in men?,
,,,,,Mmm... I don't think about it much...,,
,,,,,I do feel more energized when doing it with men...,,
,,,,,But that doesn't really matter!,,
,,,,,,I- I see...,
,,,,,Why? Do you wish to drown in ecstasy?,,
,,,,,,I'd rather keep my life...,
,,,,,,I still have things to do here.,
,,I-3,,,,,

,,,,,Come closer hun. Let's have a good time together...,,
,,,,,,"I, uh...",

,,,,,Pfft... Ahahahah!,,

,,,,,,W- what in the world? Is this... hair? Tentacles??,
,,,,,Let these tentacles of mine bring you to Nirvana!,,

,,,,,,"Whoa, whoa, stop right there-",
,,,,,But I was just getting to the good parrrrttt...,,
,,,2-1-A,III-1,Do you like him?,,

,,,,,,You like him just for his...,
,,,,,Heehee. You just don't understand.,,
,,,,,You should try doing it with him!,,
,,,,,,Wh- what!?,
,,,,,"Aww, you're blushing. So cute.",,
,,,2-1-B,II-2,You're not afraid of him?,,
,,,,,,T- talking about your king like that...,
,,,,,,Are you not afraid of him?,
,,,,,Should I be?,,
,,,,,It's rare to See a strong demon show up in our realm.,,
,,,,,We approached him... and he ended up finishing all of us off!,,
,,,,,It was the best day ever.,,
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,Heehee.,,
,,,,,,You seem to be in a good mood.,
,,,,,,Do you enjoy being on Earth?,
,,,,,Yeeeesss.,,
,,,,,"I can do it every day here, thanks to you, but...",,
,,,,,,But...,
,,,,,"As expected, no one beats Master Asmodeus...",,
,,,,,,"What are you to him, exactly?",
,,,,,Oooh? We are... I don't know...,,
,,,,,We just like to swarm over our Xing.,,
,,,,,,"So, it's like... a harem?",
,,,,,A harem he's too busy for! He can't do it with us every day.,,
,,,2-2-A,III-1,You don't help him?,,
,,,,,,You're not helping him with... whatever he's doing?,
,,,,,He's so obsessed with being the strongest in the realm...,,
,,,,,But he was already the best in bed.,,
,,,,,Hehehe...,,
,,,2-2-B,III-3,Doing something more important.,,
,,,,,,"Of course... As a ruler, he must have something more important to do.",
,,,,,But what he's doing is booooring!,,
,,,,,,What is it that he's doing?,
,,,,,He wants to be the strongest being in the realm or something...,,
,,,,,"Whatever it is, it has nothing to do with us.",,
,,,,,,"You just want to have fun, don't you?",
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,,This is new...,
,,,,,What is iiiiit? New technique?,,
,,,,,,"Um, no. Lord Willard just told me that the next client... is a woman.",
,,,,,"Ohooo? Interesting, let me take that one.",,
,,,,,,You're okay with anyone?,
,,,,,"No biggie for me, hun, as long as I can have fun.",,
,,,,,"The more they want it, the more energy I can feel in them...",,
,,,2-3-A,II-5,That's worrisome.,,
,,,,,,I- I'm kind of worried about you.,
,,,,,Whyyyy?,,
,,,,,"I live for it, Jake... I consume their passion.",,
,,,,,That's why I prefer to play with the people in the slum.,,
,,,,,,What about the clients at the Hotel?,
,,,,,Most of them only want a quickie.,,
,,,,,They spend half their time whining about being bored with their wife or something.,,
,,,,,I can't really feel their passion.,,
,,,2-3-B,II-4,It feels kind of wrong.,,
,,,,,,That... feels kind of wrong.,
,,,,,What's wrong with that?,,
,,,,,,Doing it with anybody...,
,,,,,"That, coming from the mouth of our pimp?",,
,,,,,"You're quite the hypocrite, hun.",,
,,,,,,Ugh...,
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,Hey. Hey Jake.,,
,,,,,,Yes?,
,,,,,Have you seen a Taura succubus lately?,,
,,,,,,Hmm... What's with them?,
,,,,,"I'm sad, you see. No human can keep up with me.",,
,,,,,And you prohibit me from sucking the clients' Carnal Essence dry...,,
,,,,,,It's to avoid hurting the townsfolk.,
,,,,,"That's why I need a Taura. Bring one for me, mmkay?",,
,,,2-4-A,II-5,Doing it with another succubus?,,
,,,,,,If I summoned a Taura... you would want to do it with her?,
,,,,,Their kind is big and strong...,,
,,,,,"Aggressive, too!",,
,,,,,,A- are they even OK with the likes of you?,
,,,,,We succubi don't have any problems with our partners.,,
,,,,,"That being said, the last time I tried approaching a Taura...",,
,,,,,She grabbed my horns and screamed at me.,,
,,,,,Told me to get the hell out of her place.,,
,,,,,,Uh... Were you injured?,
,,,,,Aaaahhhh... I need someone to play rough with me like that again...,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,2-4-B,III-3,Isn't that weird?,,
,,,,,,Your behavior towards humans is already bizarre enough for me...,
,,,,,,Now you're telling me you want to do it with other succubi?,
,,,,,You wanna see us in action?,,
,,,,,"Heehee. Jake, you perv.",,
,,,,,,That's not it!,
,,,,,"Aww, we've already known each other for so long. No need to be shy.",,
,,,,,,(It... hasn't been that long...),
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,Hmmmph... This is irritating.,,
,,,,,,What happened?,
,,,,,My favorite customer from the Brothel never came back.,,
,,,,,Turns out she just got married.,,
,,,,,,Oh. That's probably a good thing for her...,
,,,,,That's dumb! What's so good about being bonded with one person!?,,
,,,,,"I don't think her partner could possibly be as skillful as me, either.",,
,,,2-5-A,III-1,It's not just about that!,,
,,,,,,Marriage is not just about doing it.,
,,,,,,"To be bonded to someone, to be able to be part of one another for the rest of your lives...",
,,,,,,It makes us feel whole.,
,,,,,Trust...,,
,,,,,Does that make things more interesting in bed?,,
,,,,,,I... just said that it's not always about that.,
,,,2-5-B,III-3,That's their choice.,,
,,,,,,"Well, your customer chose to get married...",
,,,,,,It means she's taking her relationship as seriously as she can.,
,,,,,Does that even matter?!,,
,,,,,,"For us, yes.",
,,,,,,Marriage shows that we're ready to be committed.,
,,,,,,To trust and support one another for life...,
,,,,,"Hmph. Well, I can't imagine being stuck with one person for the rest of my life.",,
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,,Any problems with the clients?,
,,,,,"Hmmm? You're worried about me, Jake?",,
,,,,,,If anything... I'm more worried about the clients.,
,,,,,"Ehehehe... Don't worry, I did exactly as you say.",,
,,,,,I did not kill anyone. We all had fun.,,
,,,,,,That's a relief.,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,Why are you staring at me so intensely? You finally wanna do it with meeee?,,
,,,,,,N- no... I was thinking... is it right to view sex as pure entertainment?,
,,,,,"Dear, you're so naive.",,
,,,,,There's nothing wrong with thinking of it as a form of entertainment.,,
,,,3-1-A,III-2,It should go hand-in- hand with love.,,
,,,,,,"If I were in your shoes, I think I would feel a little empty.",
,,,,,,No matter how many times I did it with other people... I think.,
,,,,,Huh? Your sack is empty?,,
,,,,,,M- my heart...! My heart is empty!,
,,,,,I don't get it...,,
,,,,,,What I'm trying to say is... it won't ever be enough.,
,,,,,,Sex just isn't what I'm looking for.,
,,,,,"What are you looking for, then?",,
,,,3-1-B,EB,Maybe I'm too naive.,,
,,,,,,After seeing many people in this industry...,
,,,,,,Maybe I'm indeed being too naive.,
,,,,,"Heehee. It's okay, dear.",,
,,,,,"Y'know, when a naive person like you finally understands the thrill...",,
,,,,,"They lose control, just like a beast.",,
,,,,,I can't wait to see you turn into one.,,
,,,,,,I- I'm sure I won't go that far...,
,,,,,Hehe. We'll see.,,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,I'm kinda amazed that you still haven't laid a finger on me.,,
,,,,,Are you impotent or something?,,
,,,,,,Hey! That's-,
,,,,,,It's because I've made a vow to my wife.,
,,,,,"But she's dead, isn't she? Now's the time to have some fun.",,
,,,,,,"My relationship with Luna was special. No, IS special.",
,,,,,,"Before I met her, every relationship I was in felt bland.",
,,,,,,"They would be fun at first, but only for a little while.",
,,,,,Isn't that the point? To have fun?,,
,,,,,,"With Luna, I felt whole. Even if she wasn't around.",
,,,,,"I don't get the point of that ""wholeness"" feeling.",,
,,,3-2-A,EA,You need to feel it in your heart.,,
,,,,,,It's something that you need to feel.,
,,,,,Feel?,,
,,,,,,"Yes, with your heart.",
,,,,,Hmmm...,,
,,,,,,"Like when someone touches you, your chest feels light.",
,,,,,,It's like you feel safe with them.,
,,,,,... Could I try it with you?,,
,,,3-2-B,EB,It might be hard for you to understand.,,
,,,,,,It might be hard for you to understand...,
,,,,,,Since you've been living like this for a very long time.,
,,,,,Mmhmm...,,
,,,,,,But I think you can still learn how to love.,
,,,,,"I don't knowww, I'm content with how I live.",,
,,,,,,Well that’s OK then. Maybe someday though you'll change your mind.,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,"Hey, what was so good about your wife?",,
,,,,,,Huh? Why so sudden...,
,,,,,"You do this all for the sake of your wife, right?",,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,"I just don't see why, though.",,
,,,,,What do you do all this for?,,
,,,3-3-A,III-4,I do it for love.,,
,,,,,,I... I do it because I love her.,
,,,,,Love?,,
,,,,,,It gives me hope and it strengthens me through all this.,
,,,,,,I want another chance to make her happy...,
,,,,,,... Since I've failed her before.,
,,,,,"Hmmm... Does ""love"" spice things up in the bedroom?",,
,,,,,,"Uh.. Well not always, but...",
,,,,,,I felt overjoyed whenever I was with her.,
,,,,,Huh... That's interesting.,,
,,,3-3-B,EB,I miss her.,,
,,,,,,It's... because...,
,,,,,,I want to see her smile again...,
,,,,,But you can see anyone's smile.,,
,,,,,They can even show you more than a smile...,,
,,,,,... they can show you faces of ecstasy.,,
,,,,,,I believe such faces are more special when they're from the person you love.,
,,,,,Huh? Let me try smiling for you then.,,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,... is it working?,,
,,,,,,"(Ugh... Be still, my heart.)",
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,Umm... Lyst? Why did you suddenly grab my hand?,
,,,,,I'm trying to get close to you.,,
,,,,,"You said that ""love"" can Spice things up in bed.",,
,,,,,,I didn't say that-,
,,,,,"So, how is it? Do you love me now?",,
,,,3-4-A,EB,Do you have feelings for me?,,
,,,,,,It's... not that simple.,
,,,,,,These feelings need to grow over time...,
,,,,,"But we've spent a lot of time together, haven't we?",,
,,,,,,Do you even have feelings for me?,
,,,,,Feelings...,,
,,,,,Hehehe.,,
,,,,,,"You just want my body, don't you-",
,,,,,We can start from that.,,
,,,3-4-B,EA,You need to understand.,,
,,,,,,Y- you can't do that to just anyone.,
,,,,,,I know that you don't even love me.,
,,,,,Does that really matter?,,
,,,,,,"For me, yes it does.",
,,,,,,Once you get to experience being in love...,
,,,,,,Maybe you can understand me a little better.,
,,,,,"What would it feel like for me, though?",,
,,,,,,I bet you'd feel fulfilled.,
,,EA,,,She can feel butterflies in her stomach whenever Jake is around.,,
,,,,,This is the first time she's ever felt that way about someone else.,,
,,,,,"Is this the ""love"" that Jake always talks about?",,
,,,,,Lyst's mind is filled only with Jake. There's no more room for other people.,,
,,EB,,,"The more Jake teaches Lyst about love, the more he is intoxicated by her.",,
,,,,,"With Lyst becoming human, Jake is certain that he has completely taken over her heart.",,
,,,,,"How very wrong he is, as Lyst can't be satisfied with only one man.",,
13,Nimue,I-1,,,Nimue,,
,,,,,"Well, well. Humanity has come quite far since last I bequeathed my eyes upon them!",,
,,,,,,What do you mean by that?,
,,,,,Though 'tis fair to call it natural. Your kind were always such sharp innovators.,,
,,,,,To think I once saw you humans struggle in the mud! Ha!,,
,,,,,,... I'm still at loss over what you're saying.,
,,,,,"Huh. I expected brighter lights from the one with the virtue of summoning me, and yet you appear quite dim!Say, I wonder if she still walks among you.",,
,,,,,She? An acquaintance of yours?,,
,,,,,You could say that.,,
,,,,,"Though, if my acquaintance were human, I would be Visiting a grave.",,
,,,,,,Well...,
,,,1-1-A,I-2,Who was she?,,
,,,,,,"So, it was a succubus.",
,,,,,Ah! The light upstairs turns on at last!,,
,,,,,"Her name, good sir, was Yrellea. She was a succubus most impressive, perhaps too impressive for one such as you.",,
,,,,,,(Oof. She doesn't pull any punches. I wonder if this Yrellea is the same.),
,,,,,Hm? Perhaps I have offended you? Your face appears most anguished.,,
,,,,,,"Oh no, not really!",
,,,,,"Ah, then perhaps you thought ill of my acquaintance.",,
,,,,,"No matter, to envy one with her stature is quite natural, I would say!",,
,,,,,,"(Right person, wrong reason.)",
,,,1-1-B,II-2,Why did she go to the Human Realm then?,,
,,,,,,Why would she go to the Human Realm?,
,,,,,"Many reasons had she, our dearest, most enigmatic Yrellea.",,
,,,,,,Which would be?,
,,,,,"Entertain me enough, and you shall learn more of Yrellea soon thereafter!",,
,,,,,"A fair bargain, is it not?",,
,,,,,,Uh...,
,,,,,,"(Well, I shouldn't expect too much from our first encounter.)",
,,,,,"By the way, what seems to trouble you, my good sir?",,
,,,,,Perhaps you are missing one night's full rest?,,
,,,,,,People tell me that all the time.,
,,I-2,,,,,
,,,,,,So where do you think your acquaintance ran off to?,
,,,,,Look no further than where you stand!,,
,,,,,,Here... in this town?!,
,,,,,"Erm... Perhaps not. Truly, I have no way of knowing, but she is in this realm, of this I am certain!",,
,,,,,,Do you have any clues that may help me find this Yrellea?,
,,,,,You are my powerful summoner. Shouldn't you be telling me instead?,,
,,,,,Summoners require an extensive breadth of knowledge about the succubi.,,
,,,,,,I'm afraid I am the last person who could help you find her.,
,,,,,"We are in accord there. You are but a young mortal, after all.",,
,,,,,Surely no human has lived for centuries as she does.,,
,,,,,,Centuries?,
,,,1-2-A,II-3,She's been here that long?,,
,,,,,,So she has been here for that long...,
,,,,,"Ah, but for us my dear summoner, a century is naught but a held breath compared to our lifespan!",,
,,,,,"Though with the technological advancements you humans have made, I am not so sure... er...",,
,,,,,,Jake. My name is Jake.,
,,,,,But of course! Jake. I am not sure if I can even call this realm familiar anymore.,,
,,,,,Though   ‘tis pleasing to know that some things remain constant.,,
,,,,,,Carnal Essence?,
,,,,,Just so. You humans make for a most delightful harvest as ever.,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,1-2-B,II-1,"What is she to you, anyway?",,
,,,,,,"So, this succubus...",
,,,,,Hm?,,
,,,,,,What is she to you? You seem to hold her in such high regard.,
,,,,,"Back in our realm, she was an adored figure.",,
,,,,,It was not even personal admiration. You could ask the same of other succubi and they will answer similarly.,,
,,,,,,Was she a prominent figure in your realm?,
,,,,,"I may be understating this, but yes. Of sorts.",,
,,,,,"I mean no offense, but someone of your caliber would be unable to summon THE Yrellea.",,
,,,,,"But do not fret, calling upon me is already a sign of good taste. There is no shame in your lacking.",,
,,,,,,(She's more talkative when it's about this Yrellea.),
,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,,I'm so done...,
,,,,,What do you imply by that?,,
,,,,,,"I've come this far, but it still feels I'm going nowhere with this succubus operation.",
,,,,,"Regardless, desperation is a remarkable thing in mortals such as you.",,
,,,,,"You say that you are getting nowhere today, only to manage to find your answer on the morrow.",,
,,,,,"Off you go to the depths of despair and the peaks of triumph, all in your teeny tiny lifespans.",,
,,,,,,That doesn't sound like a compliment.,
,,,,,Then take it as an insult for now. Perhaps one day you shall see it differently.,,
,,,,,"I too, am looking for someone. And perhaps I too am approaching my wit's end.",,
,,,1-3-A,II-1,Who are you looking for?,,
,,,,,,"If I may, who is she?",
,,,,,"Well, there is no harm in my virtuous summoner Knowing about my mission.",,
,,,,,I seek the one known as Yrellea.,,
,,,,,She is most admired by the realm. We owe her plenty.,,
,,,,,,We?,
,,,,,Why yes. I refer to all succubi.,,
,,,,,"Truly, one may call her the most beloved among us.",,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,I shall leave the rest to the workings of your imagination.,,
,,,1-3-B,I-2,Where did she go?,,
,,,,,,"If that is so, then where did she go?",
,,,,,I am shocked by your rudeness. I bared my own heart in sympathy and yet you appear most disinterested!,,
,,,,,,W- Why?,
,,,,,"If your attention was truly piqued, surely you would have asked for her name first?",,
,,,,,,W- what if you found that rude?,
,,,,,"But I do not. Indeed, it is more rude to have not asked for her name.",,
,,,,,,"... Alright, then. What is her name?",
,,,,,She is known as Yrellea. A most admirable one.,,
,,,,,,"So, a fellow succubus?",
,,,,,"Absolutely. If you were to earn my trust, I may tell you more still!",,
,,II-1,,,,,
,,,,,Tis about time you visited. To what do I owe the pleasure?,,
,,,,,,"Um, something still bugs me.",
,,,,,"About Yrellea, i presume?",,
,,,,,,Yes. How did you know?,
,,,,,You are a most open book. Were you aware of that?,,
,,,,,"But yes, you may ask me anything you wish to know.",,
,,,,,,Why do you need to find her?,
,,,,,"My, an excellent question.",,
,,,,,"Asmodeus was not very well liked by some of us succubi. For he was a tyrant, cruel and savage.",,
,,,,,"And I, along with others, revered Yrellea for being strong, but also just.",,
,,,,,She remains the obvious choice as rightful ruler of the succubi.,,
,,,2-1-A,II-2,What actually happened?,,
,,,,,,Is there something going on for her to be banished here?,
,,,,,"Well, it just so happened that Yrellea too saw herself as fit to rule over Asmodeus.",,
,,,,,"So, she led a rebellion. Unfortunately, it failed, and she fled here.",,
,,,,,,I see there are still conflicts between your own kind.,
,,,,,"No different from you humans, wouldn't you concur?",,
,,,,,"You gravitate towards something, resource or ideology, and fight for it.",,
,,,,,"And inevitably, conflict Sprouts from opposing interests.",,
,,,,,"But I feel our cause was right, and that is why I followed her to this realm.",,
,,,,,,I understand.,
,,,2-1-B,II-3,Do you have any clue as to her whereabouts?,,
,,,,,,"Um, any idea where she is right now?",
,,,,,"Erm... None, I'm afraid. It has been centuries.",,
,,,,,In secret I wish she would have let me join her.,,
,,,,,,Why didn't you?,
,,,,,"We were ordered to stay, in case our enemies saw fit to take advantage of our civil war.",,
,,,,,But never again did she contact us! Tis as if she disappeared entirely.,,
,,,,,"Even the most loyal soldier grows impatient, and I began a quest of sorts to locate her.",,
,,,,,What luck to be summoned directly into the Human Realm by you!,,
,,,,,,Wow. Seems like there's more to you succubi than meets the eye.,
,,,,,"There is, in fact, more to it. But we shall get there soon enough.",,
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,"Ah, you grace me with your presence once more.",,
,,,,,,I was intrigued by your story.,
,,,,,More tales of woe and war? I would have thought you to find them dull.,,
,,,,,,I'm sorry. It's just really fascinating to learn about your history.,
,,,,,"Well, if you insist.",,
,,,,,"As her revolution failed, Yrellea was forced to flee into this realm.",,
,,,,,But the timing of her attack could not have been more perfect. It is a mystery as to how we failed.,,
,,,,,,Hmm...,
,,,,,Yrellea was a light in the darkness. A voice of reason telling us to throw off our shackles.,,
,,,,,"But alas, the Demon King's chains are not so easily broken.",,
,,,2-2-A,III-1,She was bold.,,
,,,,,,To stand up for what was right is most honorable.,
,,,,,Indeed.,,
,,,,,"She personally protected us countless times from Asmodeus' claws, until the day of our defeat.",,
,,,,,And there was no greater honor than to witness her upon the battlefield.,,
,,,,,"To this day, my greatest regret is that I could not follow her into our final battle.",,
,,,,,,I see... I understand.,
,,,,,"Ah, but centuries do fly by. I have a new master to attend for the time being.",,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,What are you smiling for? What ill summon would I be if I were to refuse to oblige my summoner?,,
,,,2-2-B,II-4,She was reckless,,
,,,,,,I am not so sure...,
,,,,,,But I feel that starting a civil war like that was reckless. Think of all everyone she put in danger.,
,,,,,And yet no tyrant has ever stepped down by being asked politely.,,
,,,,,"Yes, there was discord among the succubi. Yes, we brought about violence on the scale our realm had never before seen.",,
,,,,,"But in the face of great cruelty, violence is often the only catalyst for change.",,
,,,,,I am sure humans understand the need to fight for freedom.,,
,,,,,,(She sounds really passionate about it.),
,,,,,May you perhaps be growing bored after all? You appear to be staring into naught but air.,,
,,,,,,N- no! It was astounding! Take my word for it!,
,,,,,Good!,,
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,,So...,
,,,,,Yes? What is it?,,
,,,,,,About your life in the realm...,
,,,,,"A bottomless well of curiosity, aren't we?",,
,,,,,,You've told me plenty about Yrellea.,
,,,,,Especially the part where you stayed behind as she fled from the realm. I want to know what came after.,,
,,,,,"Ah, the life after the rebellion.",,
,,,,,"It is what it is. We lost, thus we had to do Asmodeus' bidding.",,
,,,2-3-A,II-4,How do you feel about it?,,
,,,,,,Did he treat you worse?,
,,,,,"It should come as no surprise, but yes.",,
,,,,,"But Asmodeus was quite unfavorable to begin with, so it was no real change for us.",,
,,,,,"Still, it was Yrellea's wish that we stayed.",,
,,,,,"So, I was there to honor it.",,
,,,,,,A sound decision!,
,,,,,"Ah, your compliments taste as sweet as Carnal Essence.",,
,,,,,,Oh well.,
,,,,,"That was a compliment, you Know?",,
,,,2-3-B,III-3,What if she never comes back?,,
,,,,,,But you've been living for hundreds of years under Asmodeus now.,
,,,,,,Is there any doubt in your mind about her return?,
,,,,,What do you mean?,,
,,,,,Tis only been a handful of centuries!,,
,,,,,,That's an extremely long time to me.,
,,,,,But not to me!,,
,,,,,I hardened my resolve the second I knew I had to face my own Sisters on the battlefield.,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,,Incredible.,
,,,,,,(I'm in awe of her iron will.),
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,,Hey.,
,,,,,Look who's back!,,
,,,,,"You have returned for more stories, I take it?",,
,,,,,,Don't even start.,
,,,,,,Your enthusiasm will infect me again.,
,,,,,"Well, isn't that a good thing?",,
,,,,,,Your devotion to Yrellea is almost blinding.,
,,,,,"Why, thank you.",,
,,,,,Though I am reminded of something.,,
,,,,,"This grand undertaking is for the revival of your wife, is it not? It bears a striking resemblance to my own fidelity.",,
,,,2-4-A,III-1,Maybe it is.,,
,,,,,,I cannot deny all of this is for Luna.,
,,,,,,But to go so far as believing she could be raised from dead seems...,
,,,,,,"Yes. It may appear delusional, the actions of a broken man.",
,,,,,But such are those who know not of true devotion!,,
,,,,,You and I are aligned in our obsessions.,,
,,,,,You and I are aligned in our pain.,,
,,,,,,Can... can we really do this?,
,,,,,"I have faith you will succeed, just as I will.",,
,,,,,,Thank you...,
,,,2-4-B,II-5,Why didn't you propose ruling together?,,
,,,,,,But why not take the lead while she's gone?,
,,,,,"I cannot. After all, I believe her to be the only one fit to rule our kind, until the very end.",,
,,,,,  ‘Tis not even a question of confidence in my own ability. Yrellea just happens to be the best candidate.,,
,,,,,,"So, this is a matter of principle.",
,,,,,Mayhaps.,,
,,,,,"Most curious, I had actually already fielded this question before from another succubus.",,
,,,,,"Back in my own realm, anyway.",,
,,,,,,What was your answer then?,
,,,,,The same as now. I refuse to lead.,,
,,,,,,Alright.,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,,You appear pretty popular in the Demon Realm for someone devoted to serving another.,
,,,,,"Spare the thought for Yrellea instead, as my Kin revere her as much as I.",,
,,,,,"That being said, there was a specific kind of succubus that followed mine around.",,
,,,,,,"So, the one who asked you about ruling in Yrellea's absence...",
,,,,,"Yes, she was one of them.",,
,,,,,"Their kind are so adorable, completely enraptured with whatever nonsense flies from my lips.",,
,,,,,Your way of asking for ever more stories reminds me of them.,,
,,,,,,I'm just glad you didn't find me annoying.,
,,,2-5-A,III-3,Any history with them?,,
,,,,,,Surely there must be some history between you two?,
,,,,,"Their Kind have walked behind mine for eons. The squires to our knights, I suppose.",,
,,,,,"If there was a reason why, it has already slipped from my memory.",,
,,,,,,You don't seem to have the same problem explaining your devotion to Yrellea.,
,,,,,"Well, this and that are different matters entirely, haha!",,
,,,,,"I must say, it tickles me to hear that from someone also consumed by devotion.",,
,,,,,,Touché.,
,,,,,Still.,,
,,,,,"Maybe there WAS something that bound my kind to theirs, long, long ago.",,
,,,2-5-B,III-1,It's because you're charming.,,
,,,,,,I can see someone as charming as you easily gaining your own followers.,
,,,,,"There is no merit in flattery, you know.",,
,,,,,,It was an honest opinion.,
,,,,,"My gratitude. But they have been following us since... well, I do not know.",,
,,,,,"Perhaps they had already been with us, when my kind's faith to Yrellea was not as strong as it is now.",,
,,,,,,Those sure are some devoted followers.,
,,,,,The irony has not escaped me.,,
,,,,,"But if I amthat charming to you, you would surely be astounded by Yrellea.",,
,,,,,,Fair enough.,
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,Jake.,,
,,,,,,What is it?,
,,,,,"Your skill at management is superb, did you know that?",,
,,,,,You have done an admirable job.,,
,,,,,,I don't know about that...,
,,,,,,I have done horrible things in the name of my wife...,
,,,,,,"I mean, just look at what I have done to you succubi. What I'm still doing to you.",
,,,,,We all have our reasons for what we do. I can understand that.,,
,,,3-1-A,III-2,I felt like quitting along the way.,,
,,,,,,I don't know how long I can handle this.,
,,,,,,I feel like I should have stopped before any of this even started.,
,,,,,,But I didn't. I am irredeemable now.,
,,,,,"Ah, but it was for love!",,
,,,,,,Still! I have used you and the others for nothing but my own interests.,
,,,,,,I...,
,,,,,"Do not fret, Jake.",,
,,,,,"Just so you know, I used you as well to find more clues about Yrellea's whereabouts.",,
,,,,,You're far better than what you claimed. Consider it a fair trade for the both of us.,,
,,,3-1-B,III-3,It is for my own selfish goals.,,
,,,,,,All the suffering I have brought upon your kind...,
,,,,,,"Yes, it was all for Luna. For my human wife.",
,,,,,,I have no pride in this.,
,,,,,,It all feels so pointless. I have done so much evil since my first summoning.,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,We always have time to do better.,,
,,,,,,I don't know if I do.,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,,... I have decided.,
,,,,,,I will help you find Yrellea.,
,,,,,Oh? So sudden?,,
,,,,,What are your reasons for doing so?,,
,,,,,Isn't the revival of your wife more important than anything else?,,
,,,3-2-A,III-4,I insist.,,
,,,,,,I need to do this for you. For all of you.,
,,,,,I see...,,
,,,,,I will remind you that I have searched for her for centuries.,,
,,,,,This is not a simple task any mere mortal may undertake.,,
,,,,,"At worst, you might put your life in danger before ever finding her.",,
,,,,,,"With how often I have been dealing with succubi, I feel like encountering her will be inevitable.",
,,,,,I can sense your determination.,,
,,,3-2-B,EB,I am not so sure.,,
,,,,,,I...,
,,,,,,"Yes, you are right.",
,,,,,I can sense your hesitation.,,
,,,,,Does your faith waver?,,
,,,,,I knew a mortal could not handle a task such as this.,,
,,,,,All is well. I cannot blame you. Even I find myself in grief over this.,,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,"Say, Jake.",,
,,,,,,Yes?,
,,,,,What do you think about faith?,,
,,,,,I do not ask this out of my own experiences.,,
,,,,,I only wish to know where I stand from your perspective.,,
,,,3-3-A,EB,Blind trust.,,
,,,,,,"Faith is to live for something, no matter what.",
,,,,,But what if the source of faith is not there?,,
,,,,,,T would still die for it.,
,,,,,And you are sure of that?,,
,,,,,,Certainly.,
,,,,,I see. You are already beyond aid as well...,,
,,,3-3-B,EA,To carry on.,,
,,,,,,"You might say it's about obedience, servitude, and such.",
,,,,,,But I believe there is something that separates faith from all those.,
,,,,,And that is?,,
,,,,,,You must honor what the source of your faith stands for.,
,,,,,,"That includes knowing when it is wrong or flawed, and fixing those mistakes. That is a perfect ",
,,,,,... I can agree with this.,,
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,,Nimue.,
,,,,,"My, my. This must be of the utmost importance for you to call upon me by name.",,
,,,,,,I've been looking for things related to Yrellea.,
,,,,,,All of it leads to the first alchemist. They passed away a long time ago.,
,,,,,And what do you imply by that?,,
,,,,,,Don't you think it's time to put your search to rest?,
,,,,,Absolutely not. I will not be dissuaded by such unreliable information.,,
,,,3-4-A,EB,It's a lost cause.,,
,,,,,,Yeah. I guess there's no stopping you.,
,,,,,What are you implying?,,
,,,,,,"I mean, the more I learned, the more I realized it was a lost cause.",
,,,,,?!,,
,,,,,,Perhaps this was all pointless after all.,
,,,,,You have surrendered already. Disappointing.,,
,,,3-4-B,EA,Might be time for you to lead.,,
,,,,,,"With how powerful you are, I believe that now is the time to lead.",
,,,,,The rebellion? I believe I have told you that I am not suited to lead at all.,,
,,,,,,"You can give the leadership to Yrellea when she returns, but this is your chance to build a path for her.",
,,,,,,Faith does not reward those who simply wait.,
,,,,,But what if I were to fail?,,
,,,,,,At least you won't fail alone.,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,Ahahahaha! I am almost convinced!,,
,,EA,,,Nimue is ready to leave her past behind.,,
,,,,,"Her life in the Demon Realm, Yrellea... None of it matters anymore.",,
,,,,,What's important for her is to get settled into her new life with Jake.,,
,,,,,"Bit by bit, both of them tidy up the place where they will live together.",,
,,EB,,,"Nimue's mind is still filled with Yrellea, whom she admired her whole life.",,
,,,,,She is certain that Yrellea is still alive somewhere in ‘the human realm.,,
,,,,,"One day, she decides to leave the house to look for Elatha, breaking her promise to be with Jake.",,
,,,,,"Jake pleads for her not to leave him, but her determination is unwavering.",,

,,,,,(Crack! Crack! Crunch!),,noIcon noCharName fontSize=Big1
,,,,,,Holy moly! Your tummy just ate another chair!,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,"Hala, why didn't you call me?",
,,,,,,"I told you to talk to me when you feel hungry, right?",
,,,,,Me... tried to stop... but can't...,,
,,,3-4-A,EA,I appreciate you trying.,,
,,,,,,"I appreciate you trying to stop it yourself, but...",
,,,,,,"Rely on me more next time, Okay?",
,,,,,,I'm afraid this whole house will be gone before I know it...,
,,,,,House... gone...?,,
,,,,,Gone... No food...?,,
,,,,,,"Yes... If we live on the street, it will be hard to keep food around...",
,,,,,No...,,
,,,,,M- me... will call Jake...,,
,,,,,,"Good to hear. I’ll try to be more attentive, too.",
,,,,,...,,
,,,3-4-B,EB,Find actual food to eat.,,
,,,,,,Have you tried to find actual food?,
,,,,,,I think I still have some in the kitchen...,
,,,,,Yes... but still hungry...,,
,,,,,,I guess there's really no helping you.,
,,,,,Sorry... Jake.,,
,,EA,,,Jake is pleased with Hala's progress. She seem to be able to pay more attention to what he is Saying.,,
,,,,,"Because of Jake's patience, Hala can be more open about her feelings as well.",,
,,,,,"With her own will, she chooses to spend the rest of her life with Jake.",,
,,EB,,,"All this time, Jake has tried his best to help Hala.",,
,,,,,"When she turned into a human, he hoped that she could listen to him better.",,
,,,,,"Instead, Hala became even more erratic.",,
,,,,,"Now eating everything in sight, she is unstoppable.",,
15,Bastet,I-1,,,Bastet,,
,,,,,Hm? What is it?,,
,,,,,,I've been wondering about something...,
,,,,,Oh! Could you be talking about this slick skeleton I have?,,
,,,,,"Well, I say that, but it's just regular old demon bones.",,
,,,,,,Eek!,
,,,,,"Aww, you wound me. They're just like the bones of any other skeleton, you know?",,
,,,,,,Still... I think any human would be freaked out by something like that.,
,,,,,And yet you can't take your eyes off of it.,,
,,,,,Curious?,,
,,,1-1-A,I-2,Is that a demon's skull?,,
,,,,,,Is that really a demon's skeleton?,
,,,,,Would you prefer a human's instead?,,
,,,,,,N- no! Please don't!,
,,,,,"Aww, but Thad a whole closet of them back in my realm! Want me to bring them over?",,
,,,,,,That's even worse!,
,,,,,"Yeah, I know. I'm just pulling your leg. Relax!",,
,,,,,,Phew...,
,,,,,"These souvenirs that I got from this realm, however, are the real deal.",,
,,,,,,"Oh, dear Celestials.",
,,,1-1-B,II-1,That's horrible!,,
,,,,,,"Still, having someone's skull on you is just...",
,,,,,"Horrible? Well, aren't you a squeamish one?",,
,,,,,,I mean...,
,,,,,,"Isn't it disrespectful to step on them? They were once people, weren't they?",
,,,,,"Uh, why do you care?",,
,,,,,,I...,
,,,,,"First of all, you don't even know whose bones these are, do you?",,
,,,,,,"Well, yes, that's true...",
,,,,,Then what's the problem?,,
,,I-2,,,,,
,,,,,,"So, Bastet.",
,,,,,Yes?,,
,,,,,,"I was wondering if you're satisfied with just Carnal Essence, or if you need more from the Human Realm.",
,,,,,"Aha! Concerned for me, are you?",,
,,,,,What's the occasion?,,
,,,,,,"No- nothing, really. I only asked out of curiosity.",
,,,,,"With a world this big, of course I want more than just Carnal Essence.",,
,,,,,I could travel the entire world and it wouldn't be enough for me.,,
,,,,,I suppose you could call it one of the charms of your realm. Keeps me coming back!,,
,,,1-2-A,II-1,What do you seek?,,
,,,,,,"So, what are you bringing back to your realm once you go home?",
,,,,,All sorts of things.,,
,,,,,"I'm no hoarder, but I do find myself taking an interest in a few trinkets.",,
,,,,,"Human skeletons, for starters.",,
,,,,,,"Uh, that's...",
,,,,,"Weird? Creepy? I suppose. It's only weird for humans, though.",,
,,,,,Human bones are quite popular in the Demon Realm!,,
,,,,,,Why am I not surprised...,
,,,,,Hm?,,
,,,,,,N- no. It's fine.,
,,,1-2-B,II-4,A place you are fond of.,,
,,,,,,"So, you want to explore this world more?",
,,,,,Yep. What of it?,,
,,,,,,"Then, is there any sort of place you're really fond of?",
,,,,,"Well, since you ask...",,
,,,,,I guess it's more mundane than what you might expect from the likes of me.,,
,,,,,,What's that?,
,,,,,There was this town in the middle of a desert...,,
,,,,,"It was not a well-known town, but it sure did surprise me.",,
,,,,,,Oh? That's interesting. How so?,
,,,,,It was their fashion sense. They managed to look wonderful on their own despite being in the middle of nowhere.,,
,,,,,Way better than wearing a human skeleton! Haha!,,
,,,,,,...,
,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,What is it?,,
,,,,,,Something's still bugging me about you...,
,,,,,Fire away! I don't mind as long as you tell me about it!,,
,,,,,"But dang, I sure came back here way sooner than I expected.",,
,,,,,,"Yes, it's about that, actually.",
,,,,,,There's something about you I can't quite put my finger on...,
,,,,,You sure that's not flattery?,,
,,,,,,O- of course not! I'm just curious.,
,,,,,"If you say so, buddy. Anyway, ask away!",,
,,,1-3-A,II-4,Your last time here?,,
,,,,,,So... when was the last time you traveled to the Human Realm?,
,,,,,"Not too long ago. Spent a decent chunk of time here, too!",,
,,,,,"But yeah, I went back to the Demon Realm right after I was done though.",,
,,,,,,I see...,
,,,,,"Lately, our kind would rather ask someone else to help gather things from this realm.",,
,,,,,,You have friends?,
,,,,,Heh. I guess you could say that. They're certainly one of a kind.,,
,,,,,They love to depend on our kind. So much so that they're happy to do what we tell them!,,
,,,1-3-B,I-2,How often do you go here?,,
,,,,,,"So, how often do you come to this world?",
,,,,,"How often? Well, I'd say more often than any other type of succubus.",,
,,,,,"Oh, the things I could tell you about places you have never been...",,
,,,,,,"Oh. Well, that explains how familiar you are with the Human Realm.",
,,,,,But of course!,,
,,,,,Feel free to ask for any anecdotes of my travels!,,
,,,,,,"(Well, she answered me.)",
,,,,,,(Though why do I have this nagging feeling that she's hiding something?),
,,II-1,,,,,
,,,,,"I must say, your realm is just jam-packed with potential souvenirs!",,
,,,,,,Such as?,
,,,,,Human skeletons.,,
,,,,,,C- can we please stop with the skeletons?,
,,,,,"Of course, I care about more than just skeletons, you doof.",,
,,,,,I don't just collect things for my own pleasure.,,
,,,,,"You see, some of my fellow sisters back in the realm have exquisite tastes in items only found here.",,
,,,,,"Naturally, that means I also collect trinkets for them whenever I'm here.",,
,,,2-1-A,II-2,"Wow, that's thoughtful.",,
,,,,,,Do people back in your realm look up to you for this?,
,,,,,I'm basically their go-to succubus for these kinds of things.,,
,,,,,Demons of all kinds come to me for things they seek here...,,
,,,,,It's not even always trinkets. Sometimes they want knowledge.,,
,,,,,,I see you have quite the reputation.,
,,,,,A hundred years and still going strong.,,
,,,,,It's already second nature for them to come to me to get what they desire.,,
,,,,,That includes things relating to humans. I might even know about them better than yourself.,,
,,,,,,Your kind do have longer lives after all...,
,,,,,Pretty much.,,
,,,2-1-B,II-3,Any examples?,,
,,,,,,What kind of succubus would be interested in the Human Realm?,
,,,,,,"Besides you and yours, for obvious reasons.",
,,,,,"If I had to pick one, I'd say the Kasu.",,
,,,,,I only needed to announce I'd be going to the Human Realm before I'd be inundated by their requests.,,
,,,,,"Who would have thought they'd be interested in gems and precious stones, eh?",,
,,,,,,"So, you actually have clients for these kinds of things...",
,,,,,Not just the Kasu either.,,
,,,,,Many others seek my help in procuring things between worlds.,,
,,,,,"Sometimes it's materials, sometime it's information.",,
,,,,,,Whoa. you must be super popular back at home.,
,,,,,"Hehe. I don't have the ego to say that of myself, Jake. That's all you.",,
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,,Hey.,
,,,,,What is it?,,
,,,,,,"You mentioned being the succubi's go-to person to procure things, right?",
,,,,,,Don't you succubi need to harvest your own Carnal Essence? Doesn't that mean they have to come here anyway?,
,,,,,We sure do. They still ask me to gather stuff for them.,,
,,,,,,Why's that?,
,,,,,"Simple. While they're here, they want to get Carnal Essence, not go exploring the great unknown.",,
,,,,,"They can do it themselves, but won't. It's a matter of convenience, not dissimilar from you humans.",,
,,,2-2-A,III-3,Are they important?,,
,,,,,,Why are you helping them?,
,,,,,I'm just carrying out my role in the Demon Realm.,,
,,,,,,But there are only so many requests one person can take on.,
,,,,,Do I look exhausted from my work?,,
,,,,,"No, right?",,
,,,,,,I guess not...,
,,,,,"You know Jake, if you want to spoil me you can just say SO, you Know?",,
,,,,,It's written all over your cute face.,,
,,,,,,"Ah, er... Right. Got it.",
,,,2-2-B,II-3,You seem to be busy.,,
,,,,,,Do you ever get overwhelmed?,
,,,,,Nah.,,
,,,,,,I thought with all of those tasks...,
,,,,,You're kidding right?,,
,,,,,I've been doing this for hundreds of years. It's second nature to me.,,
,,,,,Though there's always a set of customers who become quite the handful.,,
,,,,,,Who are they?,
,,,,,"They're called the Lamia. They often ask me to ""lend"" them my fearful little friends.",,
,,,,,,Who?,
,,,,,The Kalys! They're basically my assistants.,,
,,,,,,... Oh.,
,,,,,,(I guess I shouldn't delve further.),
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,,"Hey, um...",
,,,,,,You look really bored.,
,,,,,You're not wrong.,,
,,,,,I don't think I have enough to do in this realm.,,
,,,,,,You want to be even busier?,
,,,,,Way busier. Tons busier. I used to be buried beneath a landslide of jobs.,,
,,,,,I even needed to recruit some help now and then.,,
,,,2-3-A,III-1,Who was helping you?,,
,,,,,,I'm more curious about your time back in your realm.,
,,,,,"Oh, alright.",,
,,,,,,"So, who did you call for help?",
,,,,,The Kalys. They're a useful bunch. Would even manage things whenever I was out.,,
,,,,,,You trusted them to do that?,
,,,,,"Of course. They're competent, even though they're too shy and frightened to admit it.",,
,,,,,,How did you get their help?,
,,,,,"Well, we're friends. So, things just happened naturally.",,
,,,2-3-B,III-3,How about now?,,
,,,,,,"Then, how about now, when you're not around?",
,,,,,"My business is still kicking, even while I'm here.",,
,,,,,,"Oh? I thought it would be closed for a while, since, Y'KNOW...",
,,,,,And here I thought you were an experienced manager.,,
,,,,,"Of course, there was more to my gig than just one girl!",,
,,,,,There are quite a few Of us keeping the business going.,,
,,,,,,"So, that explains your popularity back in your realm.",
,,,,,The gears keep on turning whether I'm there or not.,,
,,,,,Unless you were to call in all of us at once...,,
,,,,,,"I- I don't think I could do that, even if I wanted to...",
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,,"So, about the other day...",
,,,,,"Yes, what is it?",,
,,,,,,"You told me that your kind are close with another kind of succubus, right?",
,,,,,"Oh, you mean the Kalys? Yes, we're quite close. What of it?",,
,,,,,,I thought for sure your kind would be lone wolves.,
,,,,,"Aww, of course not.",,
,,,,,,"Then, how do you interact with each other?",
,,,,,The Kalys practically cling to us whenever we're around.,,
,,,2-4-A,II-5,How so?,,
,,,,,,How did it... turn out like that?,
,,,,,Simple! Their kind are unable to do literally anything else.,,
,,,,,The Bastet give them something to do. Give them purpose.,,
,,,,,,And what you mean by purpose is...,
,,,,,"Helping us, of course.",,
,,,,,,That's how your kind became friends?,
,,,,,Naturally.,,
,,,,,,You just... pressured them into sharing your workload?,
,,,,,"Better than having nothing to do, no?",,
,,,,,,"(Rather shameless, this one...)",
,,,2-4-B,III-1,Sounds really fishy.,,
,,,,,,That sounds too good to be true.,
,,,,,Oh? How so?,,
,,,,,,You sound like you're taking advantage of the Kalys.,
,,,,,"The Bastet give them purpose, Jake.",,
,,,,,"We're not taking advantage of them. If anything, they're taking advantage of us.",,
,,,,,,I'm not sure I can follow...,
,,,,,The Kalys are a directionless bunch.,,
,,,,,You can say they aren't even able to live by themselves.,,
,,,,,"Good thing they fell into the right hands, eh? Otherwise, someone could abuse them!",,
,,,,,,Erm... if you say so...,
,,,,,Got a problem with that?,,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,,Those shackles...,
,,,,,The ones on the skeleton?,,
,,,,,,I just realized they kind of look familiar...,
,,,,,,"I'm not sure, though, I can't put my finger on it.",
,,,,,"Trying to test my patience, aren't we?",,
,,,,,,Were those often used by succubi?,
,,,,,"Well, they ARE for succubi.",,
,,,2-5-A,III-1,I KNOW those shackles...,,
,,,,,,"Now that I think about it, I really have seen those shackles before...",
,,,,,Really? Then tell me. Where did you see them?,,
,,,,,,It's the same as the... Kalys'...,
,,,,,Ah.,,
,,,,,,Um...,
,,,,,,So that means...,
,,,,,"Yes, Jake?",,
,,,,,Cat got your tongue?,,
,,,,,,(So that skeleton was...),
,,,,,,(I...),
,,,2-5-B,III-2,I'm overthinking this.,,
,,,,,,Hmm...,
,,,,,What's wrong?,,
,,,,,,"I don't know, I just can't remember where I've seen those shackles before.",
,,,,,If it was important then you wouldn't have forgotten about it.,,
,,,,,,I guess you're right.,
,,,,,,I'm probably just overthinking it.,
,,,,,Good. Then our talk ends here.,,
,,,,,,"(But I don't know. Somehow, I still feel uneasy.)",
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,,Um...,
,,,,,What is it? You were spacing out.,,
,,,,,,"No, I'm just...",
,,,,,Spill it.,,
,,,,,,(Bringing this up could mean trouble...),
,,,,,Is this about the Kalys?,,
,,,3-1-A,III-2,You manipulate them.,,
,,,,,,I couldn't help seeing that you manipulate them.,
,,,,,"Oh Jake, you're worried over nothing!",,
,,,,,"Of course, you would assume it's that way.",,
,,,,,,But...,
,,,,,I'm afraid this is all a big misunderstanding.,,
,,,,,The Bastet did not manipulate the Kalys.,,
,,,,,We were just tending to their needs.,,
,,,,,,How so? Weren't you just enslaving them?,
,,,,,What's so wrong with that? Especially when they need us to lead them?,,
,,,,,We give them a place to belong and a reason to live.,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,3-1-B,III-4,Do you actually help them?,,
,,,,,,But why would you do that to them?,
,,,,,,I can't comprehend why you could do such a thing to your fellow succubi.,
,,,,,"We Bastet give the Kalys purpose, a reason to live.",,
,,,,,The Kalys are quite helpful. They even feel fulfilled when they do their chores.,,
,,,,,The other succubi even think that they are dependable. What is so wrong about their way of life?,,
,,,,,,I’ll... try to understand.,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,,What are you doing with that?,
,,,,,Hm? You mean this gem?,,
,,,,,"You see, some promising man from the Brothel gave me a good deal for it.",,
,,,,,,Where is this going?,
,,,,,"You know how I deal in exploring the world for a price, right?",,
,,,,,I'm willing to take humans on as customers as well.,,
,,,,,,That...,
,,,3-2-A,III-4,How would you do that?,,
,,,,,,Will you comply with his deal?,
,,,,,Without question. It was just too good to pass up!,,
,,,,,,But then wouldn't you have to leave?,
,,,,,Hm? Who said that I'll be the one going?,,
,,,,,,Huh?,
,,,,,,But how?,
,,,,,Let's say that I have an oh-so-helpful courier to do this job for me.,,
,,,,,,What?! How do you-,
,,,,,"Haha! That'll be the last time you underestimate me, Jake!",,
,,,,,,... You really are something else.,
,,,3-2-B,EB,You can't do that!,,
,,,,,,But you can't do that!,
,,,,,Why not?,,
,,,,,,Because you still have to stay here!,
,,,,,Then you go. Help your succubus out!,,
,,,,,,I can't. I have things to do here.,
,,,,,,Unless...,
,,,,,Unless?,,
,,,,,,Unless you turn into a human. Then you'll be free to go.,
,,,,,Huh?,,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,,"Say, Bastet.",
,,,,,Yes?,,
,,,,,,"You can be rather controlling, huh?",
,,,,,"It's easier to have the more capable ones do the work, you see.",,
,,,,,"I’ll gladly give up my job as management if I ever find someone better, but alas, there is no one but me.",,
,,,,,,Do you mean it?,
,,,,,Of course not! I love being the boss. Why would I ever give it up?,,
,,,,,"The Succubus Realm is a place of hierarchies, and I am in a comfortable spot.",,
,,,3-3-A,EB,"So, you only think about yourself.",,
,,,,,,"So, it's all about you, huh?",
,,,,,What's so wrong about putting yourself first?,,
,,,,,,"Nothing too wrong, but...",
,,,,,"You humans keep going on about being free and living how you choose, right?",,
,,,,,This is how I choose to live. In comfort!,,
,,,,,,... Just forget it.,
,,,3-3-B,III-4,You seem to enjoy it.,,
,,,,,,You seem to be enjoying the way you live.,
,,,,,"It's been that way since the time of our ancestors, after all.",,
,,,,,"So, this is more or less my comfort zone.",,
,,,,,,I never thought venturing into the Human Realm would make for such good business...,
,,,,,"Well, that's what you, a human, thought about this world, right?",,
,,,,,There are way less cool things back home. Our home realm is almost empty in comparison.,,
,,,,,Which explains the other succubi's fascination with the stuff I've brought back.,,
,,,,,,I never thought anyone would find the stuff you're collecting fascinating.,
,,,,,Different strokes for different folks!,,
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,,Bastet.,
,,,,,What is it?,,
,,,,,,I've been hearing things from the townsfolk.,
,,,,,,"There's talk about you helping them around with things, is that true?",
,,,,,"Well, maybe I did. So what?",,
,,,3-4-A,EA,How did you gain their trust?,,
,,,,,,What did you do to gain their trust?,
,,,,,"Well, this and that.",,
,,,,,,Which would be?,
,,,,,What? You doubting me or something?,,
,,,,,,"N- no! I'm just curious, that's all!",
,,,,,I did tell you before I've acquired vast amounts of knowledge from my travels.,,
,,,,,"Just like the succubi back home, the humans flocked to me for information. It's all good.",,
,,,,,,That's good to hear.,
,,,,,"You can always count on me when it comes to handling people, you know.",,
,,,3-4-B,EB,Any shady deals?,,
,,,,,,"You haven't been volved into any funny business, have you?",
,,,,,"Well, that's rude. What do you mean?",,
,,,,,,"I mean, using others for your favors just like how you did with succubi?",
,,,,,"In case you've forgotten, I'm the boss. You don't get to dictate how I handle my business.",,
,,,,,Especially when you're just some weak little mortal.,,
,,,,,,I...,
,,,,,Silence.,,
,,,,,"Not another word from you, Jake.",,
,,EA,,,Being a human does not stop Bastet from doing what she likes.,,
,,,,,"Collecting artifacts awakens her adventurous spirit, a feeling that she has never experienced before.",,
,,,,,"She embarks from one journey to another with Jake, fulfilling all kinds Of requests.",,
,,,,,"For Jake, his new life with Bastet is exhilarating, his grief and pain extinguished by the thrill of adventure.",,
,,EB,,,Being a human does not stop Bastet from acting as a Know-it-all.,,
,,,,,The people of Harbaloth entrust her to carry out requests related to the search for unique artifacts.,,
,,,,,"Of course, she has no need to do it herself when she has her loyal servant.",,
,,,,,"Her servant being none other than the man who turned her into a human, Jake.",,
16,Vered,I-1,,,Vered,,
,,,,,I... where am I?,,
,,,,,,Are you okay?,
,,,,,"So, I've been summoned...",,
,,,,,Where am I?,,
,,,,,,You are in the Human Realm.,
,,,,,,Anything bothering you?,
,,,,,No. Uhh....,,
,,,,,It's just a little disorienting...,,
,,,,,,"Oh, I'm sorry...",
,,,,,"No, it's OK. I just feel like somebody told me to expect this.",,
,,,1-1-A,I-2,About what?,,
,,,,,,About being summoned?,
,,,,,Yes. I haven't gotten my bearings just yet...,,
,,,,,But I felt like I was supposed to be called by someone.,,
,,,,,,By whom?,
,,,,,,I am the one summoned you. I don't think there's a problem with-,
,,,,,Uhnnnnn..... Arrrrgh!!!,,
,,,,,Silence!,,
,,,,,I can't believe I got pulled here by some stranger!,,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,Hey!,
,,,,,,(What was THAT?),
,,,1-1-B,II-1,Are you OK?,,
,,,,,,Are you OK?,
,,,,,,Maybe you should rest first. I know this is probably all very confusing for you right now.,
,,,,,I don't know...,,
,,,,,"Um, can you do me a favor?",,
,,,,,,What is it?,
,,,,,Can you pinch me?,,
,,,,,,"Uh, okay.",
,,,,,It's fine. I just want to make sure that all of this is real.,,
,,,,,,(Maybe just a little pinch...),
,,,,,Don't touch me!,,
,,,,,,What?!,
,,,,,Take one step closer and I’ll tear that arm off!,,
,,,,,,(What's with the sudden aggression?!),
,,I-2,,,,,
,,,,,Why are you here?!,,
,,,,,,"Well, I-",
,,,,,Enough! I will...,,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,"Ugh... So, I've returned here yet again...",,
,,,,,,Um... yes?,
,,,,,I... What happened??,,
,,,,,I couldn't Seem to notice your presence...,,
,,,,,,I...,
,,,,,,(She doesn't seem to remember anything about yesterday...),
,,,1-2-A,II-1,Was that your other self?,,
,,,,,,I've been meaning to ask this...,
,,,,,,But you weren't yourself yet at the time so...,
,,,,,"It's fine, you don't have to hold back.",,
,,,,,,Was that a different self of yours?,
,,,,,"So, you've met her.",,
,,,,,,"Um, perhaps.",
,,,,,"Indeed, you have.",,
,,,,,,(She's neither denying nor confirming my question.),
,,,,,,(It will probably take time for her to talk about it.),
,,,,,What's wrong?,,
,,,,,,"No, nothing.",
,,,1-2-B,II-2,You felt different.,,
,,,,,,We were in town for the whole day.,
,,,,,We were?,,
,,,,,,"Yes, but you didn't seem to remember all of it.",
,,,,,,It's like you are missing fragments of your memories.,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,(She just nods),
,,,,,,I don't think you're in any condition to answer that right now.,
,,,,,Sorry...,,
,,,,,,"No, it's fine. Please take it easy.",
,,,,,Thank you. I apologize I couldn't answer right away.,,
,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,,(This smell...),
,,,,,,Did you do something to this room?,
,,,,,"Um, I am not sure of what are you talking about.",,
,,,,,,It smells like roses.,
,,,,,I don't understand what do you mean.,,
,,,,,,"I mean, I don't think your room felt like this before.",
,,,,,,It feels different here.,
,,,,,"Oh no, did I do something I was not aware of?",,
,,,1-3-A,I-2,What do you mean?,,
,,,,,,I don't understand.,
,,,,,,What do you mean by something you weren't aware of?,
,,,,,Oh.,,
,,,,,Sorry. Forget I said anything.,,
,,,,,,You look pale. Are you feeling OK?,
,,,,,We are. It is none of your concern.,,
,,,,,,Ah! I'm sorry!,
,,,,,Your concern is trivial. We do not need your help.,,
,,,,,,I- I am just worried.,
,,,,,Then leave at once. You are not welcome at the moment.,,
,,,1-3-B,II-3,Flowers.,,
,,,,,,"I've seen other succubi, but you truly look different.",
,,,,,How so?,,
,,,,,,There are roses on you. It makes you look completely different from the others.,
,,,,,Is that... Do you mean a plant from this realm?,,
,,,,,,Indeed.,
,,,,,,The thorny yet beautiful features look just like yours.,
,,,,,Was that an insult to our being?,,
,,,,,,No! It was the opposite!,
,,,,,The way you put it made it seem as if there was something wrong with us.,,
,,,,,"Speak truthfully, and you will be forgiven.",,
,,,,,,I am honest! It's the other way around!,
,,,,,I will hold you to it.,,
,,,,,,(She has a dangerous side to her...),
,,II-1,,,,,
,,,,,,"Um, there is something that puzzles me.",
,,,,,,Are all of your kind like this?,
,,,,,I What do you mean?,,
,,,,,,I mean...,
,,,,,,There are two sides of you that are vastly different.,
,,,,,,"Is it just you alone, or is it a common trait?",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,I did meet others that have these... circumstances.,,
,,,,,Maybe all of us have this condition.,,
,,,,,,I see...,
,,,2-1-A,II-2,All of them?,,
,,,,,,"So, it's natural for you?",
,,,,,Probably. We've already found ourselves with this condition a long time ago.,,
,,,,,,I see...,
,,,,,,May I know the reasons for this condition existing? This all seems very peculiar to me.,
,,,,,I... I am not sure if I could explain it properly to you...,,
,,,,,"But, well, it's best if you don't inquire into the matter any further.",,
,,,,,"You hear me? If she gets bothered about it, the headache afterwards will be MY problem.",,
,,,,,,I... I see. I will refrain for now.,
,,,,,,(I'm getting used to these sudden changes...),
,,,,,,(But it sure feels very weird coming from her.),
,,,2-1-B,II-4,I have concerns.,,
,,,,,,I can't help but think it's tough for you to live this way.,
,,,,,"I am fine with this. It feels confusing at times, but I'm used to it.",,
,,,,,,I see.,
,,,,,,I just want to tell you that it's fine to confide in me.,
,,,,,,Tell me if you need anything.,
,,,,,Thank you.,,
,,,,,But I'm not so sure...,,
,,,,,,About?,
,,,,,I am not sure if I can tell whenever she is going to appear.,,
,,,,,,I understand. It's fine.,
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,"Well, what do we have here? It's you.",,
,,,,,,Is it you?,
,,,,,"It is me, of course.",,
,,,,,,"I mean, the actual you.",
,,,,,"Can't you tell, mortal? It's still me.",,
,,,,,"Oh, you mean my other self? She's away.",,
,,,,,,Were you always like this?,
,,,,,Naturally. We've been together ever since we were born.,,
,,,,,Are you disappointed I am not as docile as her?,,
,,,2-2-A,II-3,Since the beginning?,,
,,,,,,"So, you two were born this way.",
,,,,,Certainly. Are you perplexed?,,
,,,,,,I think I am.,
,,,,,To think you could be dumbstruck by something so simple.,,
,,,,,You should look at your sorry self right now.,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,"But do not fret, this is how it's meant to be.",,
,,,,,Especially for the succubi that claim an abominable origin.,,
,,,,,,So there really is more to your condition than meets the eye.,
,,,,,Indeed. Let that sink in for today.,,
,,,2-2-B,III-3,What is your purpose?,,
,,,,,,You keep appearing at unexpected moments.,
,,,,,,Is there something that causes you to come out?,
,,,,,"If she's unable to explain it to you, then expect nothing different with me.",,
,,,,,"Well, it's not like she's actually willing to talk about it.",,
,,,,,,Because it's something that forces you to come out?,
,,,,,Perhaps.,,
,,,,,But I am not the one who you should ask about this.,,
,,,,,,I see.,
,,,,,My time is up.,,
,,,,,You should not bother her right now.,,
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,,You look very different from the other succubi.,
,,,,,Is that so...,,
,,,,,I have been thinking about that...,,
,,,,,It seems like it's the reason behind the discord between our kind and the others.,,
,,,,,,How so?,
,,,,,"Out of all succubi, only our Kind took forms resembling plants.",,
,,,,,"So, I understand why you say I look different from the others.",,
,,,2-3-A,II-4,Your relationship with the others.,,
,,,,,,I was actually meaning to ask something else.,
,,,,,,How is your relationship with the other succubi?,
,,,,,I don't know...,,
,,,,,,"Um, what do you mean by that?",
,,,,,We never interact much with the other kinds.,,
,,,,,"We isolated ourselves, so we never had to talk to anyone besides each other.",,
,,,,,,So is this discord merely a projection of yours?,
,,,,,Perhaps... I am sorry I disappoint you.,,
,,,,,,N- no! Don't feel bad!,
,,,,,,I am thankful you actually told me about it!,
,,,2-3-B,II-5,Your relationship with the Demon King.,,
,,,,,,"I had a different question for you, actually.",
,,,,,,"There is a definite ruler of your own realm, right?",
,,,,,"Indeed, there is.",,
,,,,,"If it is about how we fare with the Demon King, I do not have much opinion about him.",,
,,,,,"f Well, her, on the other hand...",,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,Are you trying to call her?,
,,,,,H- how did you know?,,
,,,,,,"Um, you don't have to force it.",
,,,,,,I am enjoying your company as is.,
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,,"Say, Vered.",
,,,,,"What is it, Jake?",,
,,,,,,"Now that you've lived here for quite some times, how are you finding it?",
,,,,,Hmm...,,
,,,,,I can say that this realm is acceptable. I feel quite comfortable in your world.,,
,,,,,,I'm glad that you feel comfortable.,
,,,,,Truly. The sunlight is a fresh sight to look at.,,
,,,,,Living here feels kinda peaceful.,,
,,,2-4-A,III-4,About her other side...,,
,,,,,,"So, why doesn't your other self show up as much as she used to?",
,,,,,I don't know...,,
,,,,,I really don't have an answer for that.,,
,,,,,,I see...,
,,,,,"I could never tell exactly when she would appear, but...",,
,,,,,She very rarely interrupts me anymore.,,
,,,,,,Are you ever worried about her showing up in the future?,
,,,,,She has been a part of me since we were born.,,
,,,,,There is no reason to worry about her. She will be fine.,,
,,,,,,"Alright, then.",
,,,2-4-B,III-1,Better to stay here?,,
,,,,,,"So, is it better to stay here than back in your home realm?",
,,,,,Seems so...,,
,,,,,"I suppose that, as time goes on, I feel more comfortable talking to others in this realm.",,
,,,,,I never expected I could converse this much all by myself.,,
,,,,,,That's good to hear.,
,,,,,It is all thanks to you.,,
,,,,,I could never have had this level of freedom without you accompanying me.,,
,,,,,,... You give me too much credit.,
,,,,,Even if it is my honest opinion?,,
,,,,,,I... Thank you.,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,"Oh, that was surprising.",,
,,,,,,"Oh, it's you...",
,,,,,"She's sleeping, so I took over.",,
,,,,,Did she try to call me by herself?,,
,,,,,,"Apparently, yes.",
,,,,,That's rare.,,
,,,,,,Is it?,
,,,,,I just never expect her to do it.,,
,,,,,"You see, it is the first time she willingly let me take over her body.",,
,,,2-5-A,III-3,How did things go back in the Demon Realm?,,
,,,,,,How did it usually go back in your realm?,
,,,,,,"I mean, if you don't mind telling me.",
,,,,,I guess it's fine.,,
,,,,,I took over her consciousness whenever she was in danger.,,
,,,,,Which is precisely why it is surprising for her to take the initiative.,,
,,,,,,Danger? Were you protecting her back home?,
,,,,,"Always, I still am.",,
,,,,,,Even from the Demon King?,
,,,,,"I'd say it's even better to have him ruling, contrary to what you likely believe.",,
,,,,,"With him, all other succubi are too occupied to even bother us.",,
,,,,,,So that's how you see it.,
,,,,,"Now, please do not bother her sleep. You should rest as well.",,
,,,2-5-B,III-1,She was looking for you.,,
,,,,,,I think she was looking for you.,
,,,,,,She was eager to hear your opinion on what we talked about the other day.,
,,,,,That's huge.,,
,,,,,,Why?,
,,,,,She never used to seek me for idle talk.,,
,,,,,,So... is that a good thing?,
,,,,,Of course.,,
,,,,,That means she trusts you enough to let me talk to you.,,
,,,,,,Glad to know that.,
,,,,,Now shush. She is sleeping.,,
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,,Vered.,
,,,,,"Yes, Jake?",,
,,,,,,How are you feeling today?,
,,,,,Delightful. I've been going outside more lately.,,
,,,,,,Any problems?,
,,,,,"Truthfully, quite the opposite.",,
,,,,,I was walking around as myself for most of the time.,,
,,,3-1-A,III-2,Where were you going?,,
,,,,,,Nice. Have you gone anywhere nice lately?,
,,,,,Indeed I have. I'm especially fond of the Park.,,
,,,,,"I love how I can stay as myself for the whole day, uninterrupted.",,
,,,,,,That's good to hear.,
,,,,,It's a rare experience for me to have this much control over myself.,,
,,,,,"Again, I feel grateful to you for helping me feel this way.",,
,,,,,,It's nothing. Please do enjoy your time more often.,
,,,3-1-B,EB,Are you fine with it?,,
,,,,,,"Um, you didn't happen to experience anything weird?",
,,,,,What do you mean?,,
,,,,,,Did you stumble into anything peculiar along your walk?,
,,,,,,Any suddenly angry clients? Any fights randomly breaking out?,
,,,,,Um...,,
,,,,,,"I'm worried. If anything, anything bad were to happen to you...",
,,,,,I mean...,,
,,,,,,Especially if that aggressive side of yours were to emerge...,
,,,,,What... what do you mean by that?,,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,,(The windows are open. It's rare for her to open them this early...),
,,,,,"Oh, it is you!",,
,,,,,,Anything good happened lately?,
,,,,,"Do you mean the windows? A change of pace, I'd say.",,
,,,,,,You sound very happy today.,
,,,,,"Do I? Dear, you have an eye for detail.",,
,,,3-2-A,EA,Let's go out together.,,
,,,,,,So that's how it is. I'm happy for you.,
,,,,,,Can I ask you something?,
,,,,,What is it?,,
,,,,,,I think we should spend more time together.,
,,,,,Why?,,
,,,,,,There are plenty of things outside that I can take you to See.,
,,,,,,"As long as you feel comfortable with it, I think that will be good for your well-being.",
,,,,,"Sure, I don't think it's a bad idea.",,
,,,,,But are you sure it's going to be OK?,,
,,,,,,"Rest assured, you are going to be fine.",
,,,3-2-B,EB,Will she be happy as well?,,
,,,,,,That's good to hear.,
,,,,,,Wish she could experience this as well.,
,,,,,Who?,,
,,,,,,"I mean, your other self.",
,,,,,What do you mean by that?,,
,,,,,,Your kind is interested to see this realm.,
,,,,,,I feel that it would be wasteful if your other self doesn't share in the experience.,
,,,,,...,,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,,Hi there.,
,,,,,It's you!,,
,,,,,,Do you have any problems at work?,
,,,,,,Don't hesitate to tell me if you need any help.,
,,,,,"I can't remember much, but sometimes my other self took control.",,
,,,,,,Your other self?,
,,,,,Yes. I wish I could talk to her about it.,,
,,,,,"There are things that I feel like I'm capable of doing, but she won't let me.",,
,,,3-3-A,EB,She is right.,,
,,,,,,I think that she's right about that.,
,,,,,Even if I think I can solve my own problems?,,
,,,,,,It's for your own good.,
,,,,,,She does it to protect you from harm.,
,,,,,But then... I can never go anywhere without relying on her.,,
,,,,,,"I get how you feel, but I honestly think you still need to rely on her.",
,,,,,,She is just that dependable.,
,,,,,Is that so...,,
,,,3-3-B,III-4,Where to start?,,
,,,,,,Is there any way for you to talk to her directly?,
,,,,,I'm not sure about that.,,
,,,,,,I wish I could help you.,
,,,,,,I met her a few times when you were asleep.,
,,,,,Maybe we will find a way later on.,,
,,,,,I believe I can trust you to help us with that.,,
,,,,,,You're flattering me!,
,,,,,It's my honest opinion.,,
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,,"Oh, there you are.",
,,,,,You've done well to notice me quickly.,,
,,,,,"I've been delving into her mind yesterday, as I heard that wish of hers.",,
,,,,,,I figured you would.,
,,,,,"Because of her, I'm starting to think that this realm is not a bad place after all...",,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,Jake? Did she take over my body?,,
,,,3-4-A,EA,She shares the same wish.,,
,,,,,,"Um, yeah. I listened to her talking about you.",
,,,,,"So, what did she say?",,
,,,,,,She said living in this realm isn't so bad...,
,,,,,,"Apparently, she shares the same beliefs as you.",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,I... did not expect that.,,
,,,,,,"At the end of the day, she's still a part of you.",
,,,,,I guess so...,,
,,,3-4-B,EB,Come back!,,
,,,,,,"Wait, come back...!",
,,,,,W- what's wrong?,,
,,,,,,"Oh... she left right away, just like that.",
,,,,,,She left me hanging...,
,,,,,... You are acting rather odd.,,
,,,,,,Can't you just make her come back?,
,,,,,,(She just left without even finishing our talk.),
,,,,,I don't know how to do it...,,
,,EA,,,"Assured about Jake, Vered's other personality is ready to go once Vered becomes human.",,
,,,,,"She feels that Vered can live safely in the Human Realm, free from judgement.",,
,,,,,"More importantly, she knows that Vered trusts Jake with all her heart.",,
,,,,,"Thus, she leaves Vered in Jake's hands.",,
,,EB,,,"Jake finds Vered's peculiar nature fascinating, and thus he wants her for himself.",,
,,,,,"However, after all this time, he still relies too much on her other personality.",,
,,,,,Jake has failed them. That is what Vered's stronger personality believes.,,
,,,,,"One night, she makes sure Jake pays the price for trying to control her: his life.",,
17,Shyasta,I-1,,,Shyasta,,
,,,,,,"Hi Shyasta, how are you feeling?",
,,,,,(Zzz...),,
,,,,,,Hello...?,
,,,,,(Zzz..),,
,,,,,,Um... are you asleep?,
,,,,,... Mn... Who are you?,,
,,,,,,"Oh, sorry to interrupt your sleep.",
,,,,,It was a good sleep... and you ruined it.,,
,,,1-1-A,II-1,Trouble sleeping in your realm?,,
,,,,,,You look awfully tired.,
,,,,,,Do you have trouble sleeping?,
,,,,,It's... very noisy in the realm.,,
,,,,,With the new leader's ascension...,,
,,,,,Everybody is running around between here and there.,,
,,,,,,Even you?,
,,,,,"I honestly don't care. I would rather sleep... like, right now.",,
,,,,,,Going back to sleep so soon?,
,,,,,Goodnight!,,
,,,,,(Zzzz...),,
,,,1-1-B,I-2,Do you feel comfortable here?,,
,,,,,,Did you fall asleep the instant you came here?,
,,,,,"I just like to sleep, that's all.",,
,,,,,,Do you find it comfortable here?,
,,,,,It's quieter here.,,
,,,,,,"I see... Oh, I haven't introduced myself.",
,,,,,,"I'm Jake, it's nice to meet you.",
,,,,,"Nice to meet you, too.",,
,,,,,Goodnight.,,
,,,,,(Zzz...),,
,,,,,,(That was the simplest introduction I've ever had.) ,
,,I-2,,,,,
,,,,,(Zzz..),,
,,,,,,"Excuse me, Shyasta.",
,,,,,,"Oh, she's still sleeping.",
,,,,,,"She has a lot of work today, I shouldn't bother her.",
,,,,,"Mnn... What is it, Jake?",,
,,,,,,Nothing. You can go back to sleep if you're tired.,
,,,,,,We still have time before we go to town.,
,,,,,I feel okay to talk.,,
,,,1-2-A,II-3,Used to the new routine?,,
,,,,,,You seem to be enjoying your job.,
,,,,,It's normal for a succubus to suck Carnal Essence out of men.,,
,,,,,I don't even think of it as a job.,,
,,,,,,That makes sense to me.,
,,,,,Just like how you humans need to eat to live...,,
,,,,,We need Carnal Essence for the same purpose.,,
,,,,,... Alright I'm sleepy again. Let me rest for a bit.,,
,,,,,,"Okay, I understand.",
,,,,,(Zzz...),,
,,,,,,(Off she goes...),
,,,1-2-B,II-1,About the Demon Realm.,,
,,,,,,"If I may ask, what happened in the Demon Realm?",
,,,,,,You seem to be happier here.,
,,,,,The ascension of the new Master...,,
,,,,,"Some disagree with it, so they are fighting over it.",,
,,,,,,They?,
,,,,,The succubi.,,
,,,,,,"Huh, so not all of you are on good terms with each other?",
,,,,,I'm quite chill.,,
,,,,,The Ascension doesn't concern me at all.,,
,,,,,What does concern me is that they are fighting too much and it's disturbing my sleep.,,
,,,,,,Is that so?,
,,,,,Talking about naps makes me want to take one. Night!,,
,,,,,(Zzz...),,
,,,,,,(She can practically sleep on command...),
,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,Why are you looking at me like that? I can't sleep...,,
,,,,,,You look just like a child...,
,,,,,I look like a what?,,
,,,,,,"Oh, sorry! It just slipped out-",
,,,,,"I'm older than you, you know!",,
,,,,,Even older than your great-grandparents.,,
,,,1-3-A,I-2,Being an adult succubus.,,
,,,,,,It still baffles me how you're actually way older than me.,
,,,,,"Yes, so don't treat me like a kid.",,
,,,,,I'm an adult succubus.,,
,,,,,,"Then, as an adult, you should be able to communicate with others...",
,,,,,,"... Without using me as a mediator, right?",
,,,,,No way.,,
,,,,,,Why not?,
,,,,,It's such a hassle. I prefer to sleep.,,
,,,,,,How about with me?,
,,,,,What do you mean?,,
,,,,,,"You can talk to me more often, for starters.",
,,,,,"Tch, if you insist.",,
,,,1-3-B,II-3,"She's a succubus, despite her appearance.",,
,,,,,,"Because of your appearance, sometimes I forget that you're a succubus...",
,,,,,My appearance has nothing to do with anything.,,
,,,,,You're insulting me.,,
,,,,,,"I didn't mean to, I was just saying-",
,,,,,"I find that insulting, so don't say it again.",,
,,,,,,A- all right. I'm sorry.,
,,,,,You have anything else to say?,,
,,,,,,Nothing...,
,,,,,Goodnight then.,,
,,,,,(Zzz...),,
,,,,,,(At least she calmed down.),
,,II-1,,,,,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,This is rare. You're already awake.,
,,,,,I had a feeling you would come around this time.,,
,,,,,,You were expecting me?,
,,,,,Don't take this the wrong way.,,
,,,,,"I just hate having my sleep interrupted, so I took preemptive action.",,
,,,,,,"Oh, yeah. You did say that it was noisy in your realm.",
,,,,,The Rebellion is responsible for that.,,
,,,,,,Rebellion?,
,,,,,"Those who oppose the new Master, Asmodeus.",,
,,,,,We used to have a queen as our leader.,,
,,,,,"However, she suddenly disappeared, and Lord Asmodeus took the throne.",,
,,,,,,"Well, if a stranger suddenly did that...",
,,,,,He claimed to be the queen's son.,,
,,,,,,Oh. So he actually had the right.,
,,,2-1-A,III-2,About the new ruler...,,
,,,,,,"How do you feel about the new ruler, though?",
,,,,,"To be honest, I don't really like him...",,
,,,,,"However, the Rebellion was a pain.",,
,,,,,,"So, you preferred to escape that chaos?",
,,,,,"No, I preferred to sleep.",,
,,,,,,That's just escaping reality.,
,,,,,"I'm more inclined to call it ""preserving my energy.”",,
,,,,,,I haven't fi-,
,,,,,(Zzz...),,
,,,,,,...,
,,,2-1-B,II-2,About your kind...,,
,,,,,,Did your kind also join the Rebellion?,
,,,,,Nah...,,
,,,,,,Let me guess: too much Work?,
,,,,,And too much energy.,,
,,,,,,"So, you preferred to just sleep?",
,,,,,Yes. I don't need to think while I sleep.,,
,,,,,"It saves my energy, you know.",,
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,Mnn... Jake?,,
,,,,,"Go away, I still want to sleep.",,
,,,,,,Do you have to be so rude?,
,,,,,You have a problem with that?,,
,,,,,,Doesn't it bother your friends?,
,,,,,"Friends, huh.",,
,,,,,I don't know if I would call them friends...,,
,,,,,,Who are you talking about?,
,,,,,The Nocti... Those clingy succubi.,,
,,,2-2-A,III-1,You're close with them?,,
,,,,,,"Oh, are you close with them?",
,,,,,They treat us like their pillows and only come when they want to sleep.,,
,,,,,,"Isn't it fun, having a friend to cuddle with?",
,,,,,But I prefer to sleep with my real pillow.,,
,,,,,,"Why don't you also use them as your pillow, then?",
,,,,,"Huh, I never thought of it like that...",,
,,,,,,Glad to help.,
,,,2-2-B,III-3,Are you bothered by them?,,
,,,,,,"Does it bother you? Their clinginess, I mean.",
,,,,,It's kind of cramped Whenever they try to sleep with me.,,
,,,,,"So, yeah. I guess.",,
,,,,,,Have you tried to talk to them about this?,
,,,,,"They won't listen, and before I know it I'm already their pillow.",,
,,,,,,That sounds rough...,
,,,,,It is.,,
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,,"How are you doing, Shyasta?",
,,,,,Dead tired.,,
,,,,,,I thought you were used to this kind of thing?,
,,,,,"But not every day, duh.",,
,,,,,"Now, dealing with a customer for more than five minutes already makes me exhausted.",,
,,,2-3-A,II-4,How about classes?,,
,,,,,,How's everything else outside of work? Do you enjoy the classes?,
,,,,,"Not really, they don't seem too useful to me.",,
,,,,,,I see. Have you tried visiting other places?,
,,,,,"Nope, too tiring.",,
,,,,,,How about we go somewhere together?,
,,,,,,"I could buy you something nice too, like a new pillow?",
,,,,,"A new pillow, eh?",,
,,,,,"Not a bad idea, actually.",,
,,,2-3-B,III-1,Do you still like it better here?,,
,,,,,,Do you still like it better here?,
,,,,,"This place is quiet and cozy, I can sleep well here, at least.",,
,,,,,"So, yes. Here is still better.",,
,,,,,,Glad to hear that you're comfortable.,
,,,,,"Yes, now I need my sleep. Goodnight, Jake.",,
,,,,,,"Okay, goodnight.",
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,,"Shyasta, I've got something to talk about.",
,,,,,What is it?,,
,,,,,,I heard from Madam M that you often fall asleep during I class.,
,,,,,,Can you do something about it...?,
,,,,,"I can't, I'm too tired from working.",,
,,,,,"So, I treat the class as my break time.",,
,,,,,,Hmm... Can you at least apologize to Madam M? She's quite vexed.,
,,,,,Why should I apologize?,,
,,,2-4-A,III-3,Maybe it's a misunderstanding?,,
,,,,,,"Maybe you can just tell her that you're tired, and she would understand.",
,,,,,Why is sleeping so bad? I already know what she's teaching us anyway.,,
,,,,,,But you're not showing any respect to her.,
,,,,,,Just explain that you're tired from working...,
,,,,,"Okay, fine. I'll talk to her if I'm up for it.",,
,,,,,,(I hope she really takes my advice to heart.),
,,,2-4-B,II-5,Things to make you stay awake.,,
,,,,,,How about we think of a way to make you stay awake?,
,,,,,Like what?,,
,,,,,,"Drink coffee, maybe?",
,,,,,Yuck. I'd rather eat dirt.,,
,,,,,The only thing that keeps me awake is when we talk like this.,,
,,,,,,"Come to think of it, you're right.",
,,,,,,How about you try to talk to the others?,
,,,,,Ugh... I’ll try.,,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,,"Hey, Shyasta...",
,,,,,(Zzz...),,
,,,,,,As soundly as ever...,
,,,,,,"Hmm, she always brings her doll everywhere, doesn't she?",
,,,,,"Hey, don't touch Mr. Belphy.",,
,,,,,,S- sorry! I thought you were asleep.,
,,,,,"I was, until you touched Mr. Belphy.",,
,,,,,,Mr. Belphy? Your doll?,
,,,,,Not just an ordinary doll.,,
,,,,,,I wonder...,
,,,,,,Is it your doll that makes you always sleepy?,
,,,,,Maybe. But it proves that Mr. Belphy is not an ordinary doll.,,
,,,2-5-A,III-2,What makes it so special?,,
,,,,,,How does hugging it feel?,
,,,,,It feels like bliss. His softness makes me forget about my problems.,,
,,,,,,Have you ever try leave him at home?,
,,,,,No.,,
,,,,,Mr. Belphy has to be with me wherever and whenever.,,
,,,,,,No wonder you can just sleep anywhere.,
,,,,,When I'm not bothered? Yes.,,
,,,2-5-B,III-1,Dolls in the Human Realm.,,
,,,,,,What about the plushies in the Human Realm?,
,,,,,,Have you tried them?,
,,,,,"Nope, never had one.",,
,,,,,But I think it would be lovely to be surrounded by those.,,
,,,,,,You really do love plushies.,
,,,,,Soft and adorable things are my favorite.,,
,,,,,,How about this:,
,,,,,,If you can try not to fall asleep during the day...,
,,,,,,I will buy some plushies for you.,
,,,,,That's a hard deal...,,
,,,,,"Fine, I'll try.",,
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,,"Good morning, Shyasta. It's nice to see that you're already up.",
,,,,,"Thanks, I knew you would come.",,
,,,,,,How are you feeling?,
,,,,,"Same as usual... Well, better I suppose.",,
,,,,,,Oh?,
,,,,,"In fact, I wish I could just stay here forever.",,
,,,,,So much better than my realm...,,
,,,3-1-A,EB,I have no problem with that.,,
,,,,,,"If it's your choice, then why not.",
,,,,,You don't mind?,,
,,,,,,Of course not! Feel free to stay here as long as you like.,
,,,,,I knew you would understand.,,
,,,,,All succubi could learn a thing or two from you.,,
,,,,,,Hahaha! I see you've already become a charmer.,
,,,,,I'm just stating facts.,,
,,,,,,"Now, do you want to go back to sleep before we start the day?",
,,,,,"Yes, please. Night!",,
,,,,,(Zzz...),,
,,,3-1-B,III-4,Aren't you just running away?,,
,,,,,,That means you're just running away from the problem.,
,,,,,I'm just coping.,,
,,,,,,But things won't get better until you face reality.,
,,,,,,"Sometimes, you have to ""wake up.""",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,"Then, what should I do?",,
,,,,,,"Face your problems, communicate with others...",
,,,,,Sounds hard...,,
,,,,,,"As long as you have the will, you can overcome anything.",
,,,,,,I'll support you.,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,,"Shyasta, come here for a second, will you?",
,,,,,I think I know what you want to talk about.,,
,,,,,It must be about Madam M.,,
,,,,,,"Yes, I heard you're still sleeping during her class.",
,,,,,,"Honestly, I don't know what to do with you anymore.",
,,,,,Rather than worrying about me...,,
,,,,,Why don't you just ignore her like I did?,,
,,,3-2-A,III-4,There are these things called consequences.,,
,,,,,,You still have to think of the consequences of your actions.,
,,,,,,Ignoring her will lead to another problem in the future. Maybe even bigger problems.,
,,,,,,"Not just for me, but also for you.",

,,,,,,Thank you.,
,,,3-2-B,III-3,I don't want to risk my job.,,
,,,,,,"I can't. Dealing with her is part of my job, too.",
,,,,,Hmph...,,
,,,,,,"I know it's hard, but if you could communicate with her...",
,,,,,,"This time, make sure you talk to her.",
,,,,,About what?,,
,,,,,,Talk to her so we won't have to have this conversation anymore.,
,,,,,,"Be honest, it's kind of a bother for you too, right?",
,,,,,"When you put it that way, then... Fine, I'll go have a talk with her.",,
,,,,,,Thank you. You're the best.,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,(Zzz...),,

,,,,,,Problems?,
,,,,,I don't want to talk about them.,,
,,,,,,"So, you'd rather sleep?",
,,,,,"Yes, at least I don't have to think about anything.",,
,,,3-3-A,EB,Maybe you're right.,,
,,,,,,"Is this what you always do, whenever you face a problem?",
,,,,,Duh.,,
,,,,,I just ignore it and go somewhere to sleep.,,
,,,,,No need to sweat every little thing.,,
,,,,,,"... Preserving energy, huh?",
,,,,,"Yes, finally you get it!",,
,,,,,,...,
,,,3-3-B,EA,The importance of communication.,,
,,,,,,You might want to start talking about your problems with the others.,
,,,,,,"That way, they could understand things from your perspective.",
,,,,,,"That would make things easier for you, too.",
,,,,,"I don't know about that, but if you say so...",,
,,,,,,"I can't help you every time, you know. You have to start helping yourself here.",
,,,,,Well...,,
,,,,,"I hate to say this, but maybe you're right.",,
,,,,,I'll try following your suggestion.,,
,,,,,,"That's great! Good luck, Shyasta.",
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,,Shyasta.,
,,,,,I don't want to talk about it.,,
,,,,,,"Well, Madam M finally gave up and told me to teach you myself.",
,,,,,Why can't she just let me sleep?,,
,,,,,It'll be easier that way for the both of us.,,
,,,,,,... Have you tried talking to her?,
,,,,,"Yes, but she won't listen...",,
,,,3-4-A,EA,Make an agreement with her.,,
,,,,,,Have you really tried to communicate properly with her?,
,,,,,What do you mean by communicate properly?,,
,,,,,,Explain everything to her... and maybe come to an agreement.,
,,,,,"I didn't think about that, for sure.",,
,,,,,Perhaps that's what I should have done from the beginning. I will try again.,,
,,,,,,"Good, or else the problem will just come back.",
,,,,,,"Have a good talk with Madam M, OK?",
,,,,,Yeah.,,
,,,3-4-B,EB,I will settle it for you.,,
,,,,,,"There's no other choice, then.",

,,,,,,Alright... but I hope this won't happen again.,
,,,,,I don't know about that. It's always you humans who start fights.,,

,,EA,,,"Jake always told Shyasta to face her problem, not run away from it.",,

,,,,,"She feels content with how she is living now, and feels like she has changed for the better.",,
,,,,,Even Jake is surprised by her daily improvement.,,
,,EB,,,"Jake feels that he can't leave Shyasta alone, so he continues to pamper her.",,

,,,,,The air seems to be contaminated.,,
,,,,,,It is? I didn't notice...,
,,,,,"Oh, but I can feel it quite profoundly.",,
,,,,,It's because you are here.,,
,,,,,,"Er, pardon me?",
,,,,,Leave.,,
,,,1-1-B,II-1,Are you not feeling well?,,

,,,,,"If you have nothing to say, then leave.",,
,,,,,I can't stand the sight of you.,,

,,,,,,Why are you always so agitated?,
,,,,,,If there's anything I could do to help...,
,,,,,Don't come in here. Did I not make that clear previously?,,
,,,,,,(This is going nowhere.),
,,,,,Why are you still here? Are you deaf or what?,,
,,,1-2-A,II-4,Why so hostile?,,
,,,,,,I can't seem to wrap my head around it.,
,,,,,,Why are you so eager to kick me out?,
,,,,,Who gave you the right to speak?,,
,,,,,I never recalled any lowly mortals such as yourself standing on equal footing with succubi.,,
,,,,,,Don't you hold humans in some esteem for their Carnal Essence?,

,,,,,,I...,
,,,,,"If you understand, then do me a favor and leave.",,
,,,,,,"All right, I get it...",
,,,1-2-B,II-1,Your true feelings.,,
,,,,,,You seem so aggressive towards people. What do you really think of us?,
,,,,,"Clearly, you're not our equals.",,
,,,,,,How do you figure? Especially when succubi often travel here for their needs.,
,,,,,"Tell me, my summoner: how do you feel about livestock?",,
,,,,,Do not act so high and mighty simply because you are necessary for our survival.,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,"Seriously, why do the others hold such affection for these beings?",,
,,,,,,Yes?,
,,,,,Forget I said anything.,,
,,,,,There is no way I can handle you humans.,,
,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,You.,,
,,,,,Get rid of everything in this room.,,
,,,,,,"Um, what?",
,,,,,Was I not clear enough? Get rid of everything here.,,
,,,,,,Even the bed?,
,,,,,Yes. Why would I keep the bed?,,
,,,,,,How will you sleep?,
,,,,,I'd rather just float.,,
,,,1-3-A,II-4,Anything wrong with the furniture?,,
,,,,,,Is any of the stuff broken?,

,,,,,"Pfft, no need.",,
,,,,,All of these things were made by humans.,,
,,,,,Your creations aren't worthy of my attention.,,
,,,,,,Maybe our stuff isn't suitable for your kind...,
,,,,,"Oh, it isn't just your creations. Your entire species lacks a single noteworthy quality.",,
,,,,,Now get rid of this furniture. All of it.,,
,,,1-3-B,I-2,Is floating comfortable?,,
,,,,,,Is sleeping like that even comfortable?,
,,,,,,... I don't mean to sound rude. I'm just concerned.,
,,,,,We float in our sleep all the time.,,
,,,,,It is as natural to us as breathing.,,
,,,,,,Is that so...,
,,,,,,I've learned something new.,
,,,,,How laughable. You are too easily amazed.,,
,,,,,,I've never seen any other succubi do that before.,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,I- I'm sorry! I will leave at once!,
,,II-1,,,,,
,,,,,,Excuse me...,
,,,,,You may enter.,,
,,,,,State your intentions.,,

,,,,,Flattery will get you nowhere.,,
,,,,,"Spit it out, or else I'll forbid you from ever coming here.",,
,,,,,,"There are some complaints, and not just from the clients...",
,,,,,,They said that you're a bit hard to handle.,
,,,,,You expect me to lower myself even more than this?,,
,,,,,We are superior to you humans in more ways than you can imagine!,,
,,,2-1-A,II-4,Don't you need our Carnal Essence?,,
,,,,,,But don't you and your fellow succubi need Carnal Essence?,
,,,,,I believe I told you before.,,
,,,,,Collecting Carnal Essence from you is like butchering livestock for us.,,
,,,,,What part of it don't you understand? You are nothing to us.,,
,,,,,,I do understand...,
,,,,,,But I was hoping that you could be more forgiving.,
,,,,,Who says I'm not?,,
,,,,,Letting you enter is already a sign of my grace.,,
,,,,,"Now, get lost.",,
,,,2-1-B,II-2,Don't you need humans?,,
,,,,,,"So, you don't need humans to fill your needs.",
,,,,,I don't think you lot deserve any more of my attention.,,

,,,,,,...,
,,,,,I believe there to be another way to harvest it.,,
,,,,,,Um... pardon me?,
,,,,,Tch.,,
,,,,,Forget I ever said anything.,,
,,,,,,(Another way to harvest Carnal Essence...),
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,Yes?,,
,,,,,,I'm still trying to understand your thoughts about Carnal Essence.,
,,,,,,Especially because you have to collect them from us to live.,
,,,,,I don't think that we really need to extract it... physically.,,
,,,,,There has to be another way.,,
,,,,,,"Then again, wouldn't it go against your nature as a succubus to get it from us another way?",
,,,,,How so?,,
,,,,,"As long as we get your Carnal Essence, the method doesn't matter.",,
,,,2-2-A,II-3,Can you really do that?,,
,,,,,,Is there really a way to do that?,
,,,,,Bold of you to assume I did not think this through.,,
,,,,,We have the Kasu kind cooperating with us back in the Demon Realm.,,
,,,,,Since they are well-versed on the subject of Carnal Essence...,,
,,,,,I believe our efforts will come to fruition soon enough.,,
,,,,,,"The Kasu, huh...",
,,,,,"I've told you that much, are you happy now?",,
,,,2-2-B,III-1,How do you deal with the outside world?,,

,,,,,I never said I was incapable of socializing.,,
,,,,,,But you said that you despise humans...,
,,,,,That doesn't mean I can't fake my way through formalities.,,
,,,,,We have to bide our time until we can finally be free.,,
,,,,,,What do you mean by being free?,
,,,,,"You weren't listening, were you?",,
,,,,,What did I expect from a lowly human?,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,,(I think I'm already desensitized to this kind of treatment.),
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,,Any results?,
,,,,,What are you talking about?,,
,,,,,,"Um, about your work with the Kasu?",
,,,,,Ugh...,,
,,,,,Are you here just to laugh at my misfortune?,,
,,,,,,"N- no! I swear, I was just curious!",
,,,,,"Hmph, you need to watch your tongue.",,
,,,,,Go too far and I'll rip it off.,,
,,,,,,(Eep!),
,,,,,,(She looks like she's in a really bad mood after I brought that up.),
,,,,,Well... I suppose I can tell you a thing or two.,,
,,,2-3-A,III-3,Progress with Kasu.,,
,,,,,,"So, has there been any progress?",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,"I hate to admit it, but they are still seeking out alternate solutions.",,
,,,,,However...,,
,,,,,,However?,
,,,,,I saw them bring a human man to the realm before.,,
,,,,,I believe they're dissecting him or something.,,
,,,,,Wouldn't it be nice if we could just rip you humans to shreds to get your Carnal Essence?,,
,,,,,,That sounds brutal...,
,,,2-3-B,III-1,Just accept your fate.,,
,,,,,,"If it's that difficult, why not just accept your fate?",
,,,,,No.,,
,,,,,,I'm not asking you to give up.,
,,,,,,But isn't it extremely painful to forgo Carnal Essence while doing your research?,
,,,,,Better than debasing myself to interact with lowly scum.,,
,,,,,"You only view us as tools too, don't you?",,
,,,,,I can see that.,,
,,,,,,I...,
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,Disgusting. I still have their stench on me.,,
,,,,,"Ugh, I'm gonna puke.",,
,,,,,,Are you OK?,
,,,,,"If you can use your eyes, then you can see that I am not.",,
,,,,,"Filthy humans, how dare they leave a scent.",,
,,,,,What a sickening bunch.,,
,,,,,,"Do you, uh, plan to keep hating us forever?",
,,,,,And why should you care?,,
,,,,,,... Have you ever thought about finding a better source of Carnal Essence than us humans?,
,,,,,Do I look like I haven't tried?,,
,,,,,Do YOU have any ideas? Huh?,,
,,,2-4-A,II-3,Should there be any other way?,,
,,,,,,"If there is another way, will you take it?",
,,,,,"Why bother asking? Of course, I will.",,
,,,,,Especially if it doesn't require any bodily contact with humans.,,
,,,,,,"I see, so it is still a Specific case to you.",
,,,,,,I guess you just need some more time.,
,,,,,What were you saying?,,
,,,,,,Nothing. I'm sorry for disturbing you...,
,,,2-4-B,II-5,From fellow succubi?,,
,,,,,,"Oh, I know! Maybe you can try this.",
,,,,,What is it?,,
,,,,,,How about extracting it from fellow succubi?,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,If we could do that. I would never come here at all.,,
,,,,,,So it's not possible...,
,,,,,"Disappointingly, no.",,
,,,,,It's impossible. Forget it.,,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,,"Hey, Mare, sorry for the other day.",
,,,,,Apology accepted.,,
,,,,,What's your business this time?,,
,,,,,,It's...,
,,,,,,I think it's probably used somewhere in your own realm.,
,,,,,"Speak clearly. What do you mean by ""it""?",,
,,,,,,A method to take care of your problem with Carnal Essence.,
,,,,,"Ah, that again.",,
,,,,,Didn't I tell you that we can't extract it from other succubi?,,
,,,2-5-A,III-2,Who knows?,,
,,,,,,Who knows? Maybe another type of succubus has tried?,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,If you're talking about the Lyst... then I'm not surprised.,,
,,,,,They like to play around with everybody...,,
,,,,,"By everybody, I mean even fellow succubi.",,
,,,,,,"Lyst, you say...",
,,,,,"And no, there's no Carnal Essence extracted during the...",,
,,,,,The fornication...,,
,,,,,,Where did you hear about that?,
,,,,,They told me themselves.,,
,,,,,Such vulgarity.,,
,,,2-5-B,III-3,How about male demons?,,
,,,,,,Have you ever tried with any male demons?,
,,,,,I...,,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,Ugh.,,
,,,,,,Are you OK? You seem bothered.,
,,,,,Just thinking about it makes me sick...,,
,,,,,"I... oh, no. I can't help but thinking how vulgar it would be if it could happen at all.",,
,,,,,Please leave. I suddenly feel terribly uncomfortable.,,
,,,,,,.. All right.,
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,What makes them think that they can just casually approach me?,,
,,,,,,... Is it about what happened yesterday in town?,
,,,,,,"That man just wanted to help you, you know...",
,,,,,,Since you tripped on a paving stone.,
,,,,,I can take care of myself.,,
,,,,,I don't need him to take my hand like that. It was wretched.,,
,,,3-1-A,EB,Why didn't you decline?,,
,,,,,,"Then why didn't you just refuse his help? Or mine, for that matter.",
,,,,,,"You look down on us, yet you still accept our assistance when we offer it.",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,...,
,,,,,,I give up. I can't understand you...,
,,,,,I was just talking to myself.,,

,,,3-1-B,III-2,Getting help from fellow succubi?,,

,,,,,,I see.,
,,,,,,I'll try to accommodate your wishes as best as I can.,
,,,,,What do you mean by that?,,
,,,,,,You'll see...,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,,"Hey, Mare.",
,,,,,What is it? You look much more active today.,,
,,,,,,I've decided to actively help you out.,
,,,,,,I couldn't stand to see you struggle by yourself.,
,,,,,,It hurts to see you being so afraid to be close to the others.,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,Are you underestimating me?,,
,,,3-2-A,EB,Seems like you need it.,,
,,,,,,The sight of you is just pitiful.,
,,,,,,"It's as if... well, you look like you have given up on everything.",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,"So, I AM being underestimated.",,
,,,,,And by a pathetic mortal such as you at that.,,
,,,,,,Please don't pretend you don't need it.,
,,,,,Get lost!,,
,,,3-2-B,EA,I really want to help.,,
,,,,,,No! Not at all!,

,,,,,,"(So, she trusts me after all...)",
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,,Mare...,
,,,,,Grrr... to think that all these efforts still bear no fruit.,,
,,,,,There should be a way to extract Carnal Essence without direct physical contact.,,
,,,,,"But the more I seek, the more it Seems impossible to achieve.",,
,,,,,,Mare...,
,,,,,What? Did you come here to laugh at me?,,
,,,3-3-A,EB,Just give up.,,
,,,,,,There is no way you could go against your own nature.,
,,,,,,I can't bear to see you continue waging this futile battle.,
,,,,,"Oh, so you feel victorious right now, don't you?",,
,,,,,How does it feel to be the one with power?,,

,,,,,,(She's broken by the pressure of her own obsessions...),
,,,,,,(Can I still save her?),

,,,,,No.,,

,,,,,I couldn't possibly take help from a mere human.,,
,,,,,I still have pride as a succubus.,,
,,,,,,(She still insists on doing it herself. This could end badly for her...),
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,,"Um, hey.",
,,,,,How come that there's no way for it to happen?,,
,,,,,To think I should submit myself to the deplorable humans...,,

,,,,,,I...,
,,,,,,I don't know if I can handle this anymore...,
,,EA,,,Mare's pride slowly crumbles before Jake.,,
,,,,,He has shown her that humans are not as bad as she thought.,,
,,,,,"Though a bit reluctant, she slowly opens herself up to people.",,

,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,,Those antlers...,

,,,,,,Is there a reason for it?,
,,,,,Nothing in particular.,,
,,,,,It's just fun hanging out with you humans.,,

,,,,,Please show me around when we are free later on!,,
,,,,,,Will do.,
,,,2-1-B,II-3,About social activities.,,
,,,,,,"Well, there is a good place to Visit if you want to hang out here.",
,,,,,Oh! I'd be delighted if you could tell me about it.,,
,,,,,,That place is called a pub.,
,,,,,"Tell me more, Jake!",,
,,,,,,It's short for public house. A place to relax and drink with your friends.,
,,,,,"So, it's kind of like a tavern?",,
,,,,,,"Yes, actually.",
,,,,,It's nice to hear that those kinds of place still exist.,,
,,,,,"Like I said, you humans are always coming up with interesting ways to preserve your culture.",,
,,,,,Then tonight is the perfect occasion to go there!,,
,,,,,,"W- well, I guess if you really want to...",
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,The Human Realm is such an interesting place.,,
,,,,,,You've said that countless times already.,
,,,,,"Heehee, sorry about that.",,
,,,,,But this world is so much more diverse than ours.,,
,,,,,,You certainly are enthusiastic about it.,
,,,,,I prefer to describe myself as passionate.,,
,,,,,,If you insist.,
,,,,,,But there are things I'm curious to know about you in return.,
,,,,,What is it that you want to know about me?,,
,,,2-2-A,II-4,How about the other realms?,,
,,,,,,"You must've been to many places besides the Human Realm, right?",
,,,,,,What do you think of them?,
,,,,,"Hmm... They weren't as interesting as the Human Realm, of course.",,
,,,,,There are many fascinating creatures that you can find.,,
,,,,,"But, culturally... ugh.",,
,,,,,,Yes?,
,,,,,"They're all so boring. Savage, even.",,
,,,,,,Is that so...,
,,,2-2-B,II-5,How about the Demon Realm?,,
,,,,,,How about your own realm? You rarely talk about it.,
,,,,,Because it's just as boring.,,
,,,,,"Things got a bit interesting, though, after the Queen's absence...",,
,,,,,"A demon called Asmodeus proclaimed himself the king by birthright, which caused quite a stir.",,
,,,,,,A sudden change of leader? That alone is intriguing all right.,
,,,,,"Then again, the way we succubi live was more or less unchanged.",,
,,,,,"But humans, despite their short life... they grow so rapidly.",,
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,,"So, how are you doing right now?",
,,,,,"Couldn't have been better, Jake.",,
,,,,,,"You've visited the pub, I assume?",
,,,,,"My, yes. It's is a very interesting place.",,
,,,,,,How did you find it there?,
,,,,,The fact that places like that are still predominantly full of men comes as no surprise to me.,,
,,,,,"But I can mingle with them, no problem.",,
,,,,,,That is nice to hear.,
,,,,,I bet the Lyst would be ecstatic if they were to go there.,,
,,,,,"The place exudes Carnal Essence, after all.",,
,,,2-3-A,II-4,You're not affected?,,
,,,,,,"What about you, though? You're not affected by it?",
,,,,,"With experience, you could say that I can adapt pretty easily.",,
,,,,,"And as you might already know, my interests lead elsewhere.",,
,,,,,,Socializing?,
,,,,,Precisely.,,
,,,,,"If in the end, they want to get physical with me, I'll just go along with it.",,
,,,,,That's how I get my Carnal Essence.,,
,,,,,"Sounds good, right?",,
,,,,,,... It does sound like a win-win situation.,
,,,2-3-B,II-5,You don't need the Essence?,,
,,,,,,To not be affected by it... Does it mean that you have enough Carnal Essence to get by?,
,,,,,,"You can always tell me if you need to get some Carnal Essence for yourself, though.",
,,,,,I think that it's unlikely to happen.,,
,,,,,"I mean, extracting isa very easy task for me.",,
,,,,,,I see.,
,,,,,"But thanks for your offer, Jake.",,
,,,,,"It means that I can count on you when things get bad, right?",,
,,,,,,"Bad, like... how bad?",
,,,,,"Don't think about it too much, friend.",,
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,,About your appearance...,
,,,,,,It's almost humanlike. I can't help but think of something...,
,,,,,"Oh, that's interesting. Do tell me, Jake.",,
,,,,,,Can your kind become human?,
,,,,,Now that's even more interesting.,,
,,,,,There's certainly a story about that.,,
,,,,,I heard that it involves something like making a pact...,,
,,,,,,A pact... between a succubus and a human?,
,,,,,"If you ask me, I think that it might be possible...",,
,,,,,"For succubus to turn into human, I mean.",,
,,,2-4-A,III-3,Wouldn't that become a problem?,,
,,,,,,"Wouldn't that become a problem, though?",
,,,,,A problem?,,
,,,,,,"If you turn into human, you might not be able to go back to your realm...",
,,,,,Not a problem for me!,,
,,,,,"I want the real experience of having a mortal life, anyway.",,
,,,,,,I see... ,
,,,,,Though the potential phenomenon does make me curious...,,
,,,,,"To think that there isa way for us to become human excites even you, doesn't it?",,
,,,,,,I... guess?,
,,,,,,(There she goes in her own world...),
,,,2-4-B,III-1,Can you elaborate?,,
,,,,,,"Oh, why do you think so? ",
,,,,,,Do you ever have the desire to become one yourself?,
,,,,,"It's a compelling idea, I give you that.",,
,,,,,But I'm not so sure...,,
,,,,,,"Huh, I thought you'd be more excited about it.",
,,,,,"Well, it's just hearsay.",,
,,,,,"Even if it's forbidden knowledge, I'd love to learn just a bit about it...",,
,,,,,,I can see that.,
,,,,,Right?,,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,,"So, being different from any other succubi...",
,,,,,,What does the other think of you?,
,,,,,"Well, most of them are kind enough to not mind my hijinks.",,
,,,,,"There's this one kind, though...",,
,,,,,,They don't agree with you?,
,,,,,It's the Mare type.,,
,,,,,"They're so uptight about us being superior than human, you see.",,
,,,,,That's why they don't really like our lifestyle.,,
,,,,,,"Well, whatever we do, there'll always be haters.",
,,,,,"Pfft... Yeah, you could say so.",,
,,,2-5-A,III-1,How do they see us?,,
,,,,,,So how do the others look at us humans?,
,,,,,"Of course, I can confirm the fact that the Mare kind does not like human.",,
,,,,,"But, Lyst and Hala, on the other hand, certainly have their own views.",,
,,,,,,Hearing it somehow makes me feel... weird.,
,,,,,But who wouldn't feel alienated by a different being from a different world?,,
,,,,,Especially if we don't have the chance to get to know each other.,,
,,,,,,"Well, you do have a point there.",
,,,,,"So, do you regret knowing me?",,
,,,,,,"No, not at all.",
,,,,,Good.,,
,,,2-5-B,III-3,How about the Demon King?,,
,,,,,,How does the Demon King feel about your kind's lifestyle?,
,,,,,I'm not sure... Master Asmodeus never criticizes us.,,
,,,,,But I heard that he is quite dismissive toward humans.,,
,,,,,,"He's even distant toward the succubi, from what I can tell...",
,,,,,"Hmm, what do you mean by it?",,
,,,,,,"I mean, the fact that you can roam freely between the realms makes him look kind of uncaring.",
,,,,,That's an interesting take from a human.,,
,,,,,,The way you said that... I feel like you're treating us like a curious Specimen.,
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,,Hey.,
,,,,,"Yes? Another musings of yours, Jake?",,
,,,,,,"This might sound ignorant, but when you mentioned about you liking humans...",
,,,,,,Do you merely like our culture?,
,,,,,"Huh, of course not.",,
,,,,,"Don't be so down, Jake. When I said I like humans...",,
,,,,,I meant pretty much everything about them. Though I still desire more.,,
,,,3-1-A,EA,I can show you more.,,
,,,,,,I can show you much more than just our culture.,
,,,,,Then how are you going to sate my thirst for knowledge?,,
,,,,,,"Well, first of all, the person standing in front of you is a human.",
,,,,,,There are also many facets of human beings beyond our culture.,
,,,,,,"Some of them might be ugly to look at, but... well, that's what make us human.",
,,,,,"... Well, if you may.",,
,,,,,I see no reason to refuse an offer from a man as nice as you.,,
,,,,,,(Did she just say that I'm nice...),
,,,3-1-B,III-2,Humans are troublesome.,,
,,,,,,"Humans have their own share of problems, too.",
,,,,,,I've been getting into so much trouble and deceit as a human myself.,
,,,,,"So, does that justify the things you do?",,
,,,,,,"Well, that's...",
,,,,,"See? It's just human, after all.",,
,,,,,"Despite the shortcomings, you manage to live through it.",,
,,,,,That alone is fascinating.,,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,What happened? You're quieter than usual.,
,,,,,I got harassed by someone in town.,,
,,,,,"It was nothing serious, but the way he talked down to me Was so severe.",,
,,,,,,So that's why you looked a bit down yesterday...,
,,,,,What should I do? I am so confused.,,
,,,3-2-A,EB,Do things my way.,,
,,,,,,Can you tell me what he's like?,
,,,,,His appearance?,,
,,,,,,We should make him sorry.,
,,,,,But he didn't physically harm me or anything...,,
,,,,,,But he made you uncomfortable.,
,,,,,,I don't want any of my succubi to get hurt.,
,,,,,"Goodness, you suddenly look as scary as him...",,
,,,3-2-B,EA,Do things your way.,,
,,,,,,Maybe we can talk some sense to him?,
,,,,,"Well, I do have an idea, but I'm still not sure how to do it.",,
,,,,,,What do you mean?,
,,,,,I should confront him when he's sober...,,
,,,,,,"So, it was drunken banter...",
,,,,,That seems to be the case.,,
,,,,,"Thanks for listening, Jake.",,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,Jake. I think you need to hear this.,,
,,,,,,What is it?,
,,,,,"Yesterday, someone at the Brothel told me...",,
,,,,,About a succubus who turned into a human!,,
,,,,,,Are you serious?!,
,,,,,It didn't seem like they were joking when they said it.,,
,,,3-3-A,EB,That could be bad.,,
,,,,,,(Was it one of the succubi I'm summoning...?),
,,,,,,(No... That's not possible),
,,,,,Jake? You're making quite a scary face...,,
,,,,,,"Oh, sorry.",
,,,,,,I was just thinking that... it could be bad.,
,,,,,What do you mean?,,
,,,,,,If it's one of my succubi...,
,,,,,,Then people might know what I'm after...,
,,,,,Oh.,,
,,,,,So that's how you see things...,,
,,,3-3-B,III-4,Which succubus was it?,,
,,,,,,"Umm, do you happen to know which succubus it was?",
,,,,,I have absolutely no idea.,,
,,,,,,Yikes.,
,,,,,"What do you mean, ""Yikes?""",,
,,,,,I would be happy to see how things unfold. I'll keep my ears open for the next big story.,,
,,,,,,"(Well, luckily none of my succubi are missing...)",
,,,,,,(Is it possible that there are other summoners beside me and Phillip?),
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,,"So, about yesterday's case...",
,,,,,"About ""that"" curious case?",,
,,,,,,"Yes, about that.",
,,,,,,Do you happen to know any other summoners beside me?,
,,,,,"I'm not sure, but if you're talking about summoners ages ago...",,
,,,,,I believe they are called shamans.,,
,,,3-4-A,EA,You hang with them?,,
,,,,,,So did you hang out with them back then?,
,,,,,Not at all.,,
,,,,,They have this obsessive gaze that I'm uncomfortable with.,,
,,,,,,"Do I... do I look the same as them, then?",
,,,,,"Celestials, no!",,
,,,,,"They're so obsessed with dark magic, that...",,
,,,,,"It's hard to talk to them, let alone look into their eyes.",,
,,,,,"But with you, I can talk comfortably.",,
,,,,,,I'm glad to hear that.,
,,,,,The pleasure is all mine!,,
,,,3-4-B,EB,Their source of power.,,
,,,,,,"How did they get the power to summon succubi, I wonder...",
,,,,,"By borrowing the powers of demons and the like, I assume.",,
,,,,,It would be impossible to summon us through offerings alone.,,
,,,,,,"So, that means...",
,,,,,,I... Phillip... He also uses black magic?,
,,,,,Anybody who is well-versed in this should have known about that.,,
,,EA,,,Nothing could have made Dialen happier than becoming human.,,
,,,,,"Not only that, she gets to spend the rest of her life with her favorite one.",,
,,,,,"One day, she told Jake that she wanted to have offspring, just like other couples do.",,
,,,,,"Jake welcomed her idea, and now they live happily together with their children as a family.",,
,,EB,,,How surprised Dialen was when she became human.,,
,,,,,"Finally, she could be part of something she loved.",,
,,,,,"However, there are still many facets of humanity that she still didn't understand.",,
,,,,,"Thus began her habit of observing them very, very closely.",,
20,Agash,I-1,,,Agash,,
,,,,,Who’s there?!,,
,,,,,,Eep!,
,,,,,"Oh, it's just you.",,
,,,,,,... I'd be happier if you would put your weapon down before greeting me.,
,,,,,"Oh, pardon my impudence.",,
,,,,,,Good grief...,
,,,,,You know how people usually act when surprised.,,
,,,,,,"Sure, but they aren't usually this extreme.",
,,,,,Fair point.,,
,,,,,You look concerned. Tell me if there is anything bothering you.,,
,,,1-1-A,I-2,No need to be tense.,,
,,,,,,"Um, you don't have to be so on guard...",
,,,,,,"You can relax, no one is going to hurt you here.",
,,,,,I understand that.,,
,,,,,It's just a habit.,,
,,,,,,"... As long as you understand, I guess.",
,,,,,,Um...,
,,,,,Yes?,,
,,,,,,Can you set that weapon aside while talking to me?,
,,,1-1-B,II-3,Still adapting to this realm?,,
,,,,,,Perhaps you haven't gotten used to this realm yet?,
,,,,,That might be the case.,,
,,,,,It has been so long since the last time I came to this realm.,,
,,,,,,So that's why you were so startled.,
,,,,,The thing is...,,
,,,,,I've spent most of life guarding the Demon Realm.,,
,,,,,,And you need some time adjusting to your new surroundings?,
,,,,,Verily.,,
,,I-2,,,,,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,"Um, Agash?",
,,,,,,Do you need a massage?,
,,,,,,Maybe it could help you relax...,
,,,,,"No, I don't. Why the sudden offer?",,
,,,,,,"Whenever my wife looked tense, I massaged her back to calm her down.",
,,,,,,I can do it if you need one.,
,,,,,"Thank you very much, but I have to refuse.",,
,,,1-2-A,II-1,Will resting help?,,
,,,,,,"But you look very tense, as if something might jump out at any moment.",
,,,,,That's what I should be ready for.,,
,,,,,,"Just... tell me if you need to rest, OK?",
,,,,,Maybe in a thousand years or so.,,
,,,,,,I meant if you need rest anytime soon.,
,,,,,A thousand years is a short time for us.,,
,,,,,"Moreover, we have important duties at hand.",,
,,,,,,Such as?,
,,,,,Guarding the realm...,,
,,,1-2-B,II-4,Tell me if you need any help.,,
,,,,,,Are you sure you don't need any help?,
,,,,,I will let you know if I need any.,,
,,,,,"I don't have the luxury of resting, anyway.",,
,,,,,"I have to be on guard at all times, lest I be surprised by an enemy's blade.",,
,,,,,,"... I've told you, no one's going to hurt you here.",
,,,,,How do you know that?,,
,,,,,How do I know that I can trust you?,,
,,I-3,,,,,
,,,,,Jake?,,
,,,,,,(She's not even looking at me...),
,,,,,,Can you... really see me?,
,,,,,I can see you as clear as daylight.,,
,,,,,,With that blindfold...?,
,,,,,"Oh, this?",,
,,,,,It's natural for us to wear them.,,
,,,1-3-A,II-3,Why the blindfold?,,
,,,,,,Is there a reason you wear it?,
,,,,,,Can you see normally?,
,,,,,Yes. But I'd rather not use my sight on the mundane.,,
,,,,,,Um... having sight is not what I would call mundane...,
,,,,,Because you are a mortal with no powers to be aware of.,,
,,,,,You can only see what can be seen with naked eyes.,,
,,,,,,"But then, that means you...",
,,,,,I'd like it if you refrained from asking what is behind this blindfold.,,
,,,,,It is beyond your comprehension.,,
,,,,,,... All right. I won't press further.,
,,,1-3-B,I-2,How do you see things?,,
,,,,,,"But with the blindfold, can you actually see anything?",
,,,,,Of course.,,
,,,,,I can even see the uneasiness in your eyes at this very moment.,,
,,,,,,... H- how?!,
,,,,,That's just how things are for me.,,
,,,,,Do you find it weird?,,
,,,,,,"Well, you're a demon, so I suppose it's not surprising.",
,,,,,,I'm just a bit shocked.,
,,,,,"Pfft, there's no way this piece of cloth is restraining me.",,
,,,,,,"(So, she is quite proud as well...)",
,,II-1,,,,,
,,,,,"Ah, Jake.",,
,,,,,"It's rather peaceful here, I see.",,
,,,,,,"And how is your life in the Demon Realm, if I may ask?",
,,,,,"Well, we have to stay on guard for invaders all the time.",,
,,,,,It's our very purpose to guard the Demon Realm.,,
,,,,,,It does sound serious.,
,,,,,It was the queen's order long before the current ruler took the throne.,,
,,,2-1-A,III-2,Have you ever failed?,,
,,,,,,"So, I take that you've never failed?",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,,(She looks upset... I shouldn't have asked that.),
,,,,,There was one time.,,
,,,,,I can't tell you the details.,,
,,,,,It was quite a harrowing failure.,,
,,,,,,I- I'm sorry for bringing that up...,
,,,,,It's fine.,,
,,,,,Although I will never forgive myself for it.,,
,,,2-1-B,II-2,About the current ruler...,,
,,,,,,You said that you're still adhering to the former queen's orders to this day...,
,,,,,"Her orders are absolute, even in turbulent times.",,
,,,,,We have to be willing give our lives to protect the realm.,,
,,,,,,"So, the current ruler also entrusted the safety of the realm to your Kind?",
,,,,,"Yes, although...",,
,,,,,He won't hesitate to punish us if we fail.,,
,,,,,"But even without being disciplined, the act of failing can send me into a deep despair.",,
,,,,,,(She's too hard on herself...),
,,II-2,,,,,
,,,,,If only it didn't happen...,,
,,,,,Yrellea... How could you betray your own sisters...,,
,,,,,Even abandoning the queen's orders...,,
,,,,,"!! Speak, before I cut your throat.",,
,,,,,,I- it's me.,
,,,,,"... Ah, pardon me, Jake.",,
,,,,,,It's... It's fine... more importantly...,
,,,,,,You seem to be out of it.,
,,,,,"... I did let my guard down, remembering that embarrassing failure.",,
,,,,,Our failure to stop the rebellion... and allowing their leader to get away...,,
,,,2-2-A,III-2,Ask about the leader.,,
,,,,,,The leader?,
,,,,,Her name was Yrellea.,,
,,,,,She was so insistent in liberating the realm from Master Asmodeus.,,
,,,,,,And you were supposed to stop her?,
,,,,,Her actions heavily disrupted the order in the realm.,,
,,,,,"As the ones mandated to protect it, we did as ordered.",,
,,,,,,So how did it actually end?,
,,,,,"The rebellion failed, but we made a crucial mistake.",,
,,,,,"With Yrellea missing, there's no telling when another rebellion could happen.",,
,,,2-2-B,III-3,Ask about the tragedy.,,
,,,,,,"But in the end you stopped the rebellion, right?",
,,,,,We successfully suppressed the uprising...,,
,,,,,"But the very instigator of the riot, Yrellea, escaped our grasp.",,
,,,,,,Oh...,
,,,,,There is no telling when she'll strike back.,,
,,,,,"And there is a fair chance that she fled into this realm, biding her time.",,
,,,,,,Now I can see why you're so distressed.,
,,,,,,Maybe we should end our talk...,
,,,,,I'm sorry if this made you uncomfortable.,,
,,,,,,"No, no, I should be the one apologizing.",
,,II-3,,,,,
,,,,,Jake.,,
,,,,,You're visiting me fairly often these days.,,
,,,,,,"O- oh, I didn't realize.",
,,,,,,I- it's just... I feel at ease whenever I am here.,
,,,,,Is that so?,,
,,,,,,"It is. I don't know how to say it, but...",
,,,,,,You seem... familiar.,
,,,,,"I don't quite understand, could you tell me more?",,
,,,2-3-A,III-1,I feel safe.,,
,,,,,,I feel safe around you.,
,,,,,"It's my first time hearing that... and from a human, no less.",,
,,,,,,"When I'm in your company, I get comfortable right away.",
,,,,,,It's like your presence naturally heals everything that surrounds you.,
,,,,,Maybe it has something to do with our role as guardians of the realm.,,
,,,,,,Do other succubi feel the same way?,
,,,,,It's a blessing for my kind's presence to be seen as calming.,,
,,,2-3-B,II-5,You're not so demon-like.,,
,,,,,,You're not like any other succubi.,
,,,,,,They have an intimidating aura around them... but you're different.,
,,,,,That's because you don't know much about our kind.,,
,,,,,"There's far more to us than what meets the eye, Jake.",,
,,,,,,Does that have anything to do with your...,
,,,,,More than what's behind this blindfold.,,
,,,,,,I see...,
,,II-4,,,,,
,,,,,Jake. I don't think what you did was necessary.,,
,,,,,,Why?,
,,,,,,"The customer was rude to you. Naturally, I had to step in to resolve the matter.",
,,,,,"I understand that, but I can handle such things myself.",,
,,,,,You don't have to get involved.,,
,,,2-4-A,III-1,It's my duty.,,
,,,,,,I'm your manager. It's my duty to protect you.,
,,,,,"That being said, you should have known that I'm also a protector of my realm.",,
,,,,,I can handle trivial human matters just fine.,,
,,,,,,... If you say so.,
,,,,,,I'm sorry. That incident really got into my head.,
,,,,,It's not a problem.,,
,,,,,Thank you for understanding.,,
,,,2-4-B,II-5,Why did you refuse?,,
,,,,,,Why did you refuse my offer to help?,
,,,,,,I should be protecting you!,
,,,,,It was a minor dispute.,,
,,,,,Or did you doubt that I could handle it peacefully?,,
,,,,,,N- No. That's not what I-,
,,,,,Then why the assumption? I don't think you can solve things by being hotheaded.,,
,,,,,,I'm sorry. I didn't think I could get upset so easily.,
,,,,,"I appreciate the thought, though.",,
,,,,,It means that you really do take good care of your succubi.,,
,,II-5,,,,,
,,,,,,"Beside succubi... there are lots of other kinds of demons, right?",
,,,,,"Why, of course.",,
,,,,,Why the sudden interest?,,
,,,,,,"I'm just wondering, how do you get along with them?",
,,,,,"Well, we mostly stay in our own realms...",,
,,,,,And Master Asmodeus believes that we should be on guard about the other demons at all times.,,
,,,,,They might try to harm our world.,,
,,,2-5-A,III-4,Why the uneasiness?,,
,,,,,,Why does the Demon King think so?,
,,,,,It's in a demon's nature to conquer.,,
,,,,,"For that reason, we are no strangers to sudden conflicts.",,
,,,,,,So that explains your duty to protect your realm.,
,,,,,Yes. The very reason.,,
,,,,,,That sounds sad...,
,,,,,It is regrettable that there are some things that just can't be changed.,,
,,,,,Even our own kind can be a threat...,,
,,,,,,(I think she's remembering the rebellion...),
,,,2-5-B,III-1,Who watches over the succubi?,,
,,,,,,Then... who's watching over the succubi?,
,,,,,It is our task to guard the Demon Realm.,,
,,,,,,Is it by the order from your king?,
,,,,,Not at all. We have been guarding the realm far before Asmodeus' rise as king.,,
,,,,,,I see.,
,,,,,"Though it doesn't happen often, sometimes we must protect ourselves by use of force.",,
,,,,,Intimidation or even outright battles must be waged to keep order from breaking down on occasion.,,
,,,,,,So you don't have much say in how your lives go.,
,,,,,"Rather than a lack of options, I believe we do what we were destined to do.",,
,,,,,"And as the guardians of the realm, it is our responsibility to preserve the peace.",,
,,III-1,,,,,
,,,,,,I see that you have gone through a lot.,
,,,,,,But when did your kind come to be?,
,,,,,I still remember it like it was yesterday.,,
,,,,,We made a pledge to the rightful queen of the realm.,,
,,,,,,"Um, who is this queen that you mentioned again?",
,,,,,"Oh, it was Queen Agrath.",,
,,,,,"She was the ruler of the Demon Realm, before her disappearance...",,
,,,3-1-A,III-3,What kind of promise?,,
,,,,,,What was your promise to the queen?,
,,,,,To protect the realm from outside threats.,,
,,,,,,I see...,
,,,,,To think that real dangers were lurking nearby all along...,,
,,,,,Especially when that happened.,,
,,,,,,What happened?,
,,,,,The rebellion.,,
,,,3-1-B,III-4,If you're not the guardian...,,
,,,,,,Do you ever think about your life...,
,,,,,,"... I mean, beyond your purpose as the guardians of the Demon Realm?",
,,,,,We have no need for such things.,,
,,,,,We only wish for the safety of the Demon Realm.,,
,,,,,,I see...,
,,,,,Do not dwell on it. It is a simple but fulfilling life.,,
,,III-2,,,,,
,,,,,,"Agash, I was thinking...",
,,,,,,If the leader of the rebellion hasn't been seen to this day...,
,,,,,,Is it possible for her to be in this realm?,
,,,,,It's conceivable.,,
,,,,,But I should've noticed her if she was nearby...,,
,,,,,,Is it because of one of your abilities?,
,,,,,"Hahaha, no. It's because she was one of us.",,
,,,,,,"So... she was an Agash succubus, just like you?",
,,,,,Unfortunately so.,,
,,,3-2-A,EB,I agree with her.,,
,,,,,,I've been hearing that Asmodeus is not suitable to be your ruler.,
,,,,,,And that Yrellea was right for rebelling against him.,
,,,,,Even if she sacrificed her own sisters?!,,
,,,,,,Not everyone would have agreed to the justice that she was fighting for.,
,,,,,,"So yes, there would have been... losses",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,Those deaths... They are our kind's greatest failure.,,
,,,3-2-B,EA,You are Intelligent.,,
,,,,,,But you did what you could. You still saved some lives.,
,,,,,I worry that Yrellea will never understand why we had to stop her.,,
,,,,,"I do understand her frustrations, but...",,
,,,,,Revolt... It only throws the realm into chaos.,,
,,,,,,It wasn't wise for her to do that. Not when you have other things to worry about.,
,,,,,I'm glad that you understand my point.,,
,,III-3,,,,,
,,,,,Jake...,,
,,,,,,Is everything all right?,
,,,,,It still haunts me...,,
,,,,,Yrellea successfully escaping means she could try again.,,
,,,,,What should I do if she returns while I'm here?,,
,,,3-3-A,EB,You have done enough.,,
,,,,,,"I don't know, but it happened long before you were summoned here, right?",
,,,,,,You shouldn't think about it too much...,
,,,,,,"You should move on, as you have done your part.",
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,"I'm sorry, forget that I said anything...",,
,,,,,It was wrong of me to expect you to understand.,,
,,,3-3-B,III-4,I can understand your pain.,,
,,,,,,I understand the pain of feeling helpless.,
,,,,,,I wish I could ease your pain...,
,,,,,Thank you...,,
,,,,,I think I could trust you with something...,,
,,,,,But now is not the time. We shall rest first.,,
,,,,,,That's... the first time you've ever asked to rest.,
,,,,,Is it now?,,
,,III-4,,,,,
,,,,,I have been waiting for you.,,
,,,,,,"What is it, Agash?",
,,,,,I think this is the perfect time for me to ask this of you.,,
,,,,,,Ask what of me?,
,,,,,"We, the Agash, we were not chosen merely for our bloodline.",,
,,,,,Something else was bewstowed on us apart from our duty.,,
,,,,,Something which make us different from the other succubi.,,
,,,,,If you wish to see what is behind this blindfold...,,
,,,,,Then I'll gladly show you.,,
,,,3-4-A,EA,Please do.,,
,,,,,,If you trust me enough to do so...,
,,,,,,Then I accept.,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,"On second thought, let's refrain from doing this.",,
,,,,,,W- what?,
,,,,,"Certainly, we have something important which the others don't have.",,
,,,,,And the answer is these eyes that we protect with a blindfold.,,
,,,,,I think this explanation alone will suffice for the time being.,,
,,,,,,... Feel free to tell me more next time.,
,,,,,,I'm always happy to hear your thoughts.,
,,,,,It is as you say. I think I like Speaking to you.,,
,,,3-4-B,EB,I shall refuse.,,
,,,,,,I don't think I deserve to see what's behind it.,
,,,,,,Especially if it's that important to you.,
,,,,,...,,
,,,,,I never thought you could be this dense.,,
,,,,,"Doesn't matter. I won't show you, then, for the sake of your sanity.",,
,,,,,,... Is it that dangerous?,
,,,,,I don't know.,,
,,,,,But I can see a fragile being like you will never be able to handle it.,,
,,EA,,,"In this realm, Agash learned that humans can actually protect not just themselves but others as well.",,
,,,,,She is now convinced that she can learn many things about humans from Jake.,,
,,,,,"And so, she chooses to become human without any regrets.",,
,,EB,,,"Agash turned into a human, but still feels remorse.",,
,,,,,Everyday she remembers her past failure as a guardian of the Demon Realm.,,
,,,,,"In her new life in the Human Realm, Jake is the only thing that she has.",,
,,,,,"And so, she is determined to Protect Jake at all cost. Whether he likes it Or not.",,
